It should happen some time over the next thirty years. Suddenly, something
  very weird will happen. We will vanish into a maelstrom never experienced by
  any living creature before: the Technological Singularity. And the really
  bizarre thing is, we can’t tell you what it’s going to be like. That’s
  the problem with singularities: they are, by definition, out of reach of our
  imagination.</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FF9900"><font face="MS Sans Serif">T</font></font><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">here
  are a few things we can be pretty sure of.</font> Obviously, a thing called
  'Technological Singularity' has something to do with technology. It should be
  dramatic, hefty and sudden. Oh, and you might be interested to hear it should
  wipe our kind off of the face of the planet.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif">‘Singularity’ is a word
  from mathematics. Roughly speaking, it is a place where mathematical order
  becomes chaotic, where regularity becomes illogical and unpredictable. You
  cannot even properly call a singularity a ‘place’. It is just that: a
  singularity. For example, a black hole is a singularity. In it, time collapses
  and the laws of physics no longer apply.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><img border="0" src="images/singularity.html" align="right" hspace="2" vspace="3" width="197" height="263">In
  the 1950s, mathematician John von Neumann predicted our society is destined to
  go singularity, too. His line of reasoning was simple: we’re inventing
  things at an ever faster pace. Faster and faster it goes, until one day, the
  trend explodes. We will invent new things infinitely fast. We and our
  inventions will... ehm, go out of control.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Read how novelist and
  mathematician Vernor Vinge put it in a famous 1993 paper: &quot;This change
  will be a throwing away of all the previous rules, perhaps in the blink of an
  eye, an exponential runaway beyond any hope of control.&quot; And: &quot;We
  are on the edge of change comparable to the rise of human life on Earth.&quot;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">If you
  think that sounds pretty vague -- we agree. </font> Gladly, Vinge also helpfully pointed out a few ‘omens’ that should announce the
  Singularity. You can see some of them around already. As Singularity Day comes, computers get
  ever faster, and huge computer networks arise. More and more tasks are
  automated. Information and ideas spread ever faster. Slowly, humans will begin
  to merge with their computers, finding new ways to connect our minds to our
  computers directly. We might even genetically engineer ourselves, or find
  other ways to upgrade our intelligence.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif">And then? Next thing you know,
  some kind of superhuman consciousness awakens. Out of the computers, and out
  of us, ‘something’ arises. It is something superhuman; something super
  intelligent. Before you know it, It begins spewing out ideas and theories,
  infinitely fast. Also, it finds ways to make these ideas real at a similar,
  infinite speed.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Most likely, you're sucked up
  in the process, in some unimaginable way. Around 2030, you're tied and bound to the
  computer, remember? You'll have an interface in your brain to control
  your computer, or your brain <i>is&nbsp;</i> a computer. So probably, your
  mind suddenly goes Singularity, too.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">And
  after that.. Well, we can’t tell.</font>  </font><font face="MS Sans Serif">Perhaps
  we will leave our bodies. Maybe we will merge with our computers, break
  down the barriers of our individuality and become a train of thoughts. Maybe
  we will become a duck-shaped cloud of purple gas, who knows? Maybe
  we will overcome the restrictions of the dimensions, and become God. Now that
  would be pretty strange indeed, wouldn’t it?</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif">To us, living beings, the
  Singularity should be bad news. After all, if Von Neumann and Vinge are right,
  there won’t be any&nbsp; humans around anymore in 2030. More likely you will
  find an empty planet. Deserted buildings, empty streets. Perhaps you won't
  even find a Universe anymore. We even might&nbsp;
  have terminated the Universe, while going Singularity.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="MS Sans Serif">But at least,
  will it be good or bad? Well -- guess what: we can’t tell. In a Singularity,
  ‘good’ and ‘bad’ probably will have lost their meaning. Our kind could
  end up in a state we today-lings would call ‘god-like’. Or, depending on
  your point of view, ‘insane’.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><font face="MS Sans Serif">
  <br>
  <img border="0" src="images/blueskyimage.html" width="534" height="100"></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4" color="#FF9900" face="MS Sans Serif">So...
  Can we avoid it?</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Well, maybe we can. For one
  thing, there’s always the possibility that Vinge and Von Neumann have got it
  all wrong. Maybe there won’t arise any superhuman consciousness out of our
  computers. This is how the great mathematician Roger Penrose saw it: in his
  view, machines simply cannot become conscious. Period.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif">What’s more, instead of
  accelerating, our technology might in fact be slowing down. In 2005, physicist
  John Huebner studied the rate of technological innovation, by counting the
  number of patents and major inventions per world citizen. The outcome: the
  speed of innovation is declining! We’re simply running out of new ideas. We
  did the major inventions like the telephone and the airplane already -- and
  now we’re just doing the small stuff, making minor adjustments to our big
  ideas.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FF9900" face="MS Sans Serif">E</font><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">ven
  if we’re heading Singularity</font>, we may be able to isolate the danger.
  Or hand our computers down a strict order: &quot;Whatever you do, computer, don’t mess with
  humanity.&quot;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif">But actually, we at Exit Mundi
  aren’t too sure that will help. After all, a superhuman intelligence is no match
  for an ordinary human being. Most likely, it will drag our kind along, into
  the Singularity. Hey, it might even be fun! Think of it this way: at least we
  won’t be bothered by minor little discomforts like death, when Singularity Day arrives and we become
  'Post-Human', or more of that
  vague stuff.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">On the
  other hand</font>, as you can read elsewhere on this site, there are some
  hurdles to take first. For one thing, our technology could turn against us
  beforehand, <a href="borg.html">turning us into the Borg</a>, or <a href="Robots.html">ridding
  the planet of humans</a>. Why, after all, would a superhuman intelligence take
  us into account any more than we humans feel sorry for a microbe?</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Now that would be a bummer.
  Finally, we’re becoming God -- only to find ourselves killed by our
  machines, only moments before we succeed.</font></p>
