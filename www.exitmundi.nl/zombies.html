  </div>  To your bewilderment, she buries her teeth deep into your neck. Blood gushes
  all over the place. You die. But then again, you don’t. A few seconds later,
  you kind of wake up again. You’re unable to speak or think. Your
  personality is gone, locked away behind the gates of death. All
  that remains is a walking, decaying, bad-breathed corpse that used to be you.
  A deep roar escapes from your lips. You’re so… hungry!<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#FF9900">Pretty soon, the world is overrun by zombies just like
  you</font>. There are living dead in the streets. Living dead in the shops.
  Living dead in every house. Living dead gathering around every last
  band of normal humans. On the internet, there’s
  a pretty amazing <a href="http://kevan.org/proce55ing/zombies/" target="_blank">computer
  simulation</a> that shows what would happen if the living dead were to really
  overrun us. Bottom line: humans wouldn’t stand a chance!</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3">The zombie scenario comes in
  many forms. In some movies and books, a virus turns us into living dead. In
  others, a chemical mishap wakes up the deceased. In still others, it remains unclear what
  causes all the trouble. And maybe that’s all the better. Because no matter
  how you look at it, corpses that walk and kill are of course somewhat…
  unrealistic.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3"><font color="#FF9900">Zombies
  defy all logic.</font> How can someone who has been injured so badly that he
  can no longer live still, ehm… live? How can a rotting cadaver still stumble about and kill you? Why would it go after living humans in the first place?
  Wouldn’t it be easier if it just cooked itself a meal? Or go to
  Burger King: with a bad breath like that, they’ll surely let you go first.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><font face="Arial" size="3"><img border="0" src="zombieplat.gif" align="center" width="455" height="91"></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#FFFF00" face="Arial" size="4">Zombies:
  the facts</font><font face="Arial" size="3"><font color="#FFFF00"><br>
  <br>
  </font>Fortunately, there is no known condition that turns dead people into
  cannibalistic killer corpses. Usually, dead is dead.<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#FF9900">Indeed, some of us have made it back to the land of the
  living</font>, for example after reanimation in the hospital. But usually they
  don’t wake up with a particular appetite for raw human flesh -- even though
  they have good reason for that, considering the food they serve in hospitals.<br>
  <br>
  Yes, there are a few rare conditions that transform people into dangerous,
  raging psychopaths – the Indonesian disorder called ‘amok’ is the most
  well-known. But diseases like that have nothing to do with death nor
  cannibalism – and they aren’t contagious at all.<br>
  <br>
  Still, movies, books, comics and computer games have told and retold the
  zombie scenario again and again. One of the earliest examples is Edgar Allen
  Poe’s short story ‘The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar’ (1844), in
  which a terminally ill guy slowly turns into a living but rotting corpse after he is being
  kept from dying by hypnosis. Among the most recent examples are the
  blockbusters ‘Dawn of the Dead’ (2004) and ‘28 Days Later’ (2002) –
  the storyline we started this page with comes from Dawn of the Dead.<br>

          <b>Zombies galore:</b> In early day movies like &quot;I Walked With a
          Zombie&quot; (1943), the zombie was still a conjured guy -- not a
          flesh eating corpse.</font></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3"><font color="#FF9900">At
  the moment, there are at least 91 zombie movies</font> we know of (see <a href="http://www.wsu.edu/~delahoyd/zombie.films.html" target="_blank">this</a>
  list). And the theme has many variations, ranging from the Body
  Snatchers-movies and The Borg from Star Trek to even The Matrix, in which
  humans are turned into living dead batteries.<br>
  <br>
  So: why is it so popular? Why do zombies scare the hell out of us? Obviously,
  much of it has to do with our instinctive fear of death and our in-built
  disgust of dead bodies. Corpses and cannibalism – these are two of our
  deepest taboos, and breaking them scares the shit out of us.<br>
  <br>
  On a deeper level, some of it has to do with mass psychology and sociology. In
  western society, freedom, individualism and being able to make up your mind
  are considered the highest goods. Zombies are quite the opposite, the
  nightmare to the dream. They are the ultimate de-humanized beings.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3"><font color="#FF9900">And
  then there’s the link with voodoo.</font> Originally, ‘zombie’ is the
  African word for a conjured slave. Several West-African religions share the
  belief that a sorcerer can transform someone into a slave by stealing his
  memory, his awareness and his will. No rotting corpses involved – just an
  average guy, turned into a will-less slave.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3">In American slave times, this
  idea mixed with ancient European superstitions. For example, in New Orleans
  around 1800, white and black folks alike feared a 'zombie' that was said to
  haunt the streets. But the zombie involved had nothing to do with
  rotting corpses. It was the ghost apparition of a
  deceised French officer holding his head under his arm!</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3">On the isle of Haiti, the
  word ‘zombie’ took another twist. In 1801, the Haitian slaves revolted and
  kicked the whites off of their island – interestingly, their leader was a
  conjurer-priest, Toussaint L'Overture, who promised his followers they
  wouldn’t die during the uprising.</font></p>
    <table border="0" width="163" align="left">
      <tr>
        <td width="100%"><img border="0" src="echtezombie.gif" width="154" height="223"></td>

          <b>I, zombie:</b> A real Haitian zombie, made ill by poison.</font></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3"><font color="#FF9900">After
  that, the former slaves founded the voodoo faith</font>, a religion that is
  part catholic, and part African. Just like in Africa, Haitian voodoo-followers
  believe you can turn someone into a zombie, as a means of punishment. In
  Haiti, voodoo priests used and use puffer fish poison (‘tetrodotoxin’) to
  accomplish this. The poison, administered as a powder, produces a deep,
  dead-like coma first, and then a lethargic, vegetative state of non-being.<br style="mso-special-character:line-break">
  <br>
  It was only in the 1960s Hollywood came up with the modern day zombie: the one
  that bites. The watershed movie that gave the zombies their new image was the
  legendary horror classic ‘Night of the Living Dead’ (1968).<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#FF9900">In the meantime, quite a few real ‘zombies’ live in
  Haitian mental hospitals.</font> But they don’t bite. They are normal,
  living people, turned into plants by vicious poison. So in fact, we should
  feel sorry for the zombies. Those poor, poor living dead!</font></p>
