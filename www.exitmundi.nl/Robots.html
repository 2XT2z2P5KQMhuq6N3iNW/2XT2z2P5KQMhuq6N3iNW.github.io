Slowly,
  you step back from the window. You rub your eyes. This must be a dream, you tell yourself, yes,
  an oddball nightmare, what else can it be? But then, a crippling burst of pain
  shoots through your body. As you fall to the ground, soaking in blood, you
  turn your head. There, right next to you, is your devoted household robot
  Nelly. She痴 holding your brand new kitchen knife, uttering weird beeping
  and humming sounds of pleasure...<o:p>

  okay, so I let fantasy take over a little. But wait.</font> Robots waging war
  against their creators no longer belong to the realm of science fiction. In
  fact, the subject pops up on more and more dead serious scientific robotics
  congresses.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:12.0pt;mso-hyphenate:none"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; letter-spacing: -.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Admittedly
  -- household robots, Defense robots and automated school busses don't exist
  yet. But that is changing rapidly. Already, robots build our cars, run our
  production lines, help our surgeons in operations, dig for oil, clean our sewage
  pipes, explore distant planets, disarm land mines, fly airplanes, entertain
  our kids -- yes, they even drive cars around, albeit on experimental test
  tracks only.<o:p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:12.0pt;mso-hyphenate:none"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; letter-spacing: -.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif">There's
  absolutely no doubt robots will become ever more important. They will fight
  our wars, cook our meals, take care of transportation and even satisfy our sexual
  needs. As long as there's a demand and money to be made, new robots will show
  up, taking care of an ever-growing list of tasks and jobs.<o:p>
  </o:p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:12.0pt;mso-hyphenate:none"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; letter-spacing: -.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">But
  the real revolution</font> will come from Artificial Intelligence: computer
  software that is capable of learning by itself. As we speak, Artificial
  Intelligence is undergoing a BIG revolution. From data storage programs that
  learn how to make sense out of human voices to computers that learn how to
  recognize alien life forms (no, really!) -- it's all there. And the
  combination with robotics is, of course, also made. As we speak, the first
  artificial intelligent robots are learning how to perform simple tasks, such
  as steering around objects or plugging themselves into a power point before
  their batteries run out.<o:p>
  </o:p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:12.0pt;mso-hyphenate:none"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; letter-spacing: -.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif">So,
  is the world becoming a better one? A lot of people think so. But wait,
  there's a BIG problem here. <o:p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:12.0pt;mso-hyphenate:none"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; letter-spacing: -.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif">The
  next-generation robot will make up its own mind -- literally. It will acquire
  huge amounts of knowledge, simply because computer brains hold more
  information than human brains. It will think faster, learn faster, and
  outsmart us many, many times -- some AI-scientists estimate that within only
  some twenty to thirty years, an everyday robot will outsmart humans by several
  BILLIONS of times. And although it is speculative, many experts believe the
  robots will even develop something like a consciousness.<o:p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:12.0pt;mso-hyphenate:none"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; letter-spacing: -.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">So
  there we are</font>, surrounded by super smart computers on legs that may even
  have a certain kind of awakening consciousness. It will give a lot of people
  the creeps.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:12.0pt;mso-hyphenate:none"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; letter-spacing: -.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif">According
  to the Belgium robotics pioneer Hugo the Garis, who makes a hobby out of
  preaching doom and destruction, this will cause war. It will be the `haves'
  against the `have-nots'; the people who have the robots against the people who
  don't. The latter group will want to smash all robots to bits; the first will
  firmly believe that robots are essential for human progress. As De Garis
  coined it, it will be a war between the `Cosmists' and the `Terrans'. Of
  course, chances are the `Cosmists' (the ones with the robots) will win. After all, they have at their
  disposal armies of super smart, invulnerable robot warriors. Millions
  will die in this unprecedented, unique, and undoubtedly very bloody World War.<o:p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:12.0pt;mso-hyphenate:none"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; letter-spacing: -.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif">But
  hey, that's not the biggest problem.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:12.0pt;mso-hyphenate:none"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; letter-spacing: -.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Our
  robots will have different needs than us. To put it bluntly: a human runs on
  food and drink, a robot needs power and oil. But there's no need for humans to
  take care of robot needs. That, after all, is what we have robots for! So it's
  more likely we'll have robots that repair and feed other robots, and more
  robots that take care of the production of electricity and oil. In effect,
  this means there will be a split between our own, human economy, and an
  entirely separated robot economy.<o:p>
  </o:p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:12.0pt;mso-hyphenate:none"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; letter-spacing: -.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">And
  it goes well beyond that.</font> Weird as it may sound, chances are the robots
  will develop a separate robot society. Let's face it: there's not much we can
  offer an artificial intelligent robot, right? Compared to the robots, we are
  `off-line' a considerable amount of time every day as we sleep, we make bad
  chess players, and we probably won't be able to offer the robot much
  entertainment.<o:p>

  </div><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; letter-spacing: -.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif">So,
  what will an artificial intelligent robot do when we DON'T use it? Probably,
  it will hang around a little. Perhaps it will play a game of super fast chess
  with another robot. Maybe it will contact some fellow robots, chitchatting
  about nothing in particular, like Fermat's last theorem or string theory. One
  thing's for sure: it's very likely the robots will give shape to a separate,
  entirely new society on Earth, now that humans have become so boringly
  slow-witted.<o:p>

  </font></span>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:12.0pt;mso-hyphenate:none"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; letter-spacing: -.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Also,
  the robots will come up with new plans. They will design new technology, work
  out novel theories, create new space programs, set up undreamed of science
  experiments to find out more about nature. And yes, they will invent and build
  new robots to do it. More and more, the robots will go their own way, becoming
  completely independent of humans.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:12.0pt;mso-hyphenate:none"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; letter-spacing: -.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">Perhaps
  a war of robots versus men will be inevitable in the end.</font> Let's face
  it: once the artificial intelligent robots hit the scene, humans are the
  annoying species on Earth. We're imperfect, quite uncontrollable, irrational
  and prone to all kind of errors and system failures. And besides, we waste
  robot time with our constant requests for food and production.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:12.0pt;mso-hyphenate:none"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; letter-spacing: -.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Sooner
  or later, it's more than likely the robots will decide they've had it with
  humanity. They will take over. They will send some robot troops into town,
  execute the bigger part of us, and put the rest of humanity behind bars, for
  scientific testing, or merely for entertainment. There will be human zoos and
  human testing facilities. Everything will be the other way around. This time,
  we will be the ones doing the dirty and the dangerous work for the robots.<o:p>
  Who knows they'll even use us for batteries, like in The Matrix!</o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:12.0pt;mso-hyphenate:none"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; letter-spacing: -.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif">But
  also, there's an alarming possibility the robots decide the world is better
  off without humans after all. Humanity will be simply eliminated. Good
  riddance, the robots will say to each other. We might call the robots
  rebellious. But the robots would think otherwise. After all, humans are the ones who run
  amok all the time, against nature, against fellow humans, or against the
  robots. Humans are by far the less reliable species.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:12.0pt;mso-hyphenate:none"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; letter-spacing: -.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Oh,
  but surely, there will be a way of keeping the robots under control, you might
  say. We値l program the robots so that they値l never, ever mess around with
  a human being. We値l simply install some kind of big red switch, enabling us
  to turn all the robots off?<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">Well,
  that may be a bit of a problem.</font> When we think of robots, we usually
  think of the rather clumsy, hydraulic machines that stumble mutely around in
  our factories. We're just NOT used to the idea of Artificial Intelligence
  robots walking the streets. And one thing is for sure: it is very unlikely a
  generation of robots that is capable of outlearning humans billions of times
  will be fooled by some prime directive or a red switch. So when those first AI
  robots come to help in your home, better lock away your kitchen knives!<o:p>
