  </div>Okay,
  so Neptune and Pluto, that's a long way away. The Kuiper Belt sits some forty
  to fifty times further out from the Sun than we do. But as computer
  simulations show, that might change. From time to time, the gravity of the
  outer planets will disturb the Belt, and sling a huge piece of rock straight
  into the inner solar system. Doom will come rushing straight towards us.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;mso-hyphenate:
none"><span lang="EN-US" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif">One
  problem is, we will hardly see it coming. The Kuiper Belt was discovered very late, partly because the comets it contains move slowly, and partly because
  it isn't made of solid pieces of rock. Most of the supercomets in the Kuiper
  Belt are `dirty snowballs' made of dust and ice, making them incredibly hard
  to detect with modern equipment.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;mso-hyphenate:
none"><span lang="EN-US" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">Calculations
  show that there are at least 70,000 of these icy objects out there.</font> And
  most of them are really big: the first that was detected -- an object dubbed
  `QB1' -- is about two hundred kilometers across. By comparison: the killer
  meteor that wiped out the dinosaurs and almost all life on earth some 65
  million years ago was only ten kilometers across, twenty times as small as
  QB1. Some experts argue that Pluto and its moon Charon themselves are to be
  considered as part of the Kuiper Belt.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;mso-hyphenate:
none"><span lang="EN-US" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Gladly,
  the chances of such a super comet actually hitting the Earth are vanishingly
  small. The Earth is only a tiny pea in the vastness of the Universe, and is
  `protected' against incoming comets by the gravitational fields of other
  planets.</font></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;mso-hyphenate:

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;mso-hyphenate:
none"><span lang="EN-US" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif">But
  then again, <a href="Comets.html"> full impact</a> is not the biggest threat the Kuiper Belt poses. As a
  Kuiper Belt comet comes rushing in, its icy surface will heat up. Eventually,
  when it comes too close to the Sun, it will explode. Its remains will be
  scattered all over the place. The dust will be attracted by the Sun's gravity,
  and clot together into a temporary ring of dust around the Sun. The debris
  will block some of the Sun's heat. And when that happens, we're in big, big
  trouble.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;mso-hyphenate:
none"><span lang="EN-US" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Temperatures
  on Earth will drop rapidly. The dust will trigger an <a href="When%20Ice%20Age%20Comes%20to%20Town.html"> Ice Age</a> on
  Earth. Oh, and then there's the realistic danger our planet is <a href="Comets.html"> hit by comets</a>
  after all, with all those chunks of comet debris flying around in our part of
  the solar system.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;mso-hyphenate:
none"><span lang="EN-US" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">Obviously,
  what grim destiny exactly awaits us depends on a lot of things.</font> Many of
  them are determined by pure chance. One particular nasty Kuiper Belt scenario
  involves an <a href="When%20Ice%20Age%20Comes%20to%20Town.html"> all-out Ice
  Age</a>, in which so much of the Sun's heat is blocked
  that the entire Earth turns into a barren, frozen planet. The Earth's climate
  thermostat (being the intricate interplay between oceans, land, vegetation and
  algae) would be severely deregulated. It would take the planet hundreds of
  thousands, if not millions of years to recover. Of course, the chances of
  survival would be slim in a stone-cold world with frozen oceans and no soil to
  grow your food on.<o:p>
  </o:p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;mso-hyphenate:
none"><span lang="EN-US" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif">But
  here's the good news: with or without humans, the planet eventually will
  survive. It did so before. In the Pre-Cambrian age (more than 600 million years
  ago), the Earth survived several super Ice Ages. But then again, in those
  days the most complicated life forms on the planet were tiny shrimps and
  snails, crawling around in the deepest depths of the ocean.<o:p>
