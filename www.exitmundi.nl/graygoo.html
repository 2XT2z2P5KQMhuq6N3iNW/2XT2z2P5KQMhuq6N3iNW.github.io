  was no one less than the Nobel prize winning physicist Richard Feynman who
  gave rise to the `problem'. In a famous 1959 lecture, Feynman predicted that
  man will some day be able to make <b>nano machines</b>, devices so tiny that
  you can't even see them. A nanometer is a billionth of a meter, and a nano
  machine would be a thousand times smaller than the thickness of a human
  hair.<o:p>

  mr. Feynman wasn't drunk when he predicted this. Machines ARE getting
  smaller: just compare the microchips of today with the huge
  taperecorder-like computers from the fifties. But it can go much smaller
  still. In principle, Feynman foretold, you can make computers and other
  gadgets out of single atoms. You only have to `click' them together in the
  right way, like tiny pieces of construction lego.<o:p>

  he was right. In 1986, the physicist K. Eric Drexler took up Feynman's ideas,
  and coined the term <b>nanotechnology</b>: `the technology of creating and
  working with devices only a few nanometers big', as it is defined. In 1990,
  the world realised that this was no longer science fiction, as a team of IBM
  researchers managed to arrange 35 single xenon atoms so that they spelled out
  the logo of IBM. Rumour has it that another research team responded to this
  crafty display of atom knitting by doing some intellectual nano graffiti: `Bill Gates sucks', also jotted down in single xenon atoms.<o:p>

  since then, nanotechnology has underwent a modest revolution. With the
  coming of the <b>Atomic Force Microscope</b>, which uses a tiny `needle' to
  explore the surface of materials, scientists have been able to `pick up'
  single atoms and move them elsewhere. Numerous universities and
  privately funded institutes engage in nanotech. Nano engineers have at their
  disposal a toolkit full of crafty gadgets, ranging from nano
  trains that transport atoms across a nano track, to a nano pen that squirts
  out atoms instead of ink. Also, there's a growing collection of nano
  switches, nano wires, nano tubes and - more recently - the first nano
  `engines': rotor shaped molecules that rotate&nbsp; under the influence of the
  right changes in temperature and light.<o:p>

  philosophers foresee that one day (some estimate around 2010) it will be
  possible to create a <b>nano assembler</b>: a man made molecule, that is
  `programmed' to create certain things out of raw materials. A nano assembler
  would for instance pick up plain carbon atoms and rearrange them into the
  molecular structure of a diamond. Or it would make water out of the atomic
  parts of plain air. Or a cheese sandwich out of dust. Or water into wine,
  you name it.<o:p></o:p>

  notion is not as weird as it sounds. Our DNA- and RNA-molecules do it all the
  time! They pick up the raw materials from our food, and turn them into complex molecules. DNA and RNA are
  nano assemblers that manufacture whole organisms, with arms and legs, and
  fingers that can type the word `nanotechnology'.</font></span></p>

  if a nano factory can be programmed to create a cheese sandwich out of atoms,
  why wouldn't it be able to create new nano factories? This in fact is
  exactly the way it will be, at least according to nanopioneers like K. Eric
  Drexler. Let's face it: it's a hell of a job to build a nano machine by hand.
  It would be much easier to make nano machines that are capable of copying
  themselves, much in the way DNA-molecules replicate
  themselves. Nano scientists claim it is even essential for a nano
  machine to be self-replicating. Since they are so tiny, we would need millions
  of them to be of any use. It would take a lifetime to make them all by hand. Nano factories are thus
  by definition <b>Von Neumann machines</b>: devices capable of creating new copies of themselves.<o:p></o:p>

  there's a nasty downside. What will such a self-replicating nano machine do
  if you carelessly tossed it away? You guessed it: it would go on
  grabbing all atoms within reach, rearranging them into copies of itself. And
  the copies would make more copies of themselves. And those copies would make
  even more copies of the copies of the copies. And so on.<o:p>

  you just DON'T want to know what this means. Within only 72 hours after the
  release of the first molecular nano machine, every single atom on earth
  would be `used' to create new nano machines. In other words, all plants,
  animals, humans, cars, buildings and even rocks would have been `eaten up'
  by a vast, exponentially growing army of invisibly small nano devices.</font></span></p>
