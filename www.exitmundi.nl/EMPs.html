    what if our machines suddenly broke down? Not just your TV set or your car

  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">Well, not everything.
  You are still alive and doing fine, and so are all other people, as well as

  </div>Now isn't that lovely.
  There you are, in your civilized world. Suddenly, you’re stumbling about in
  the dark. The only way to go some place, is on foot. Basic stuff like clocks,
  fridges, boilers, washing machines and lights will never work again. Pretty
  soon, your tap will stop delivering water, your money will run out, and the
  shops will be empty. The economy grinds to a halt, throwing you back into
  the Middle Ages. And no way you’re gonna dial 911 or e-mail your
  Congressman. Better use a homing-pigeon, from now on.</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3"><font color="#FF9900">What
  you’ve witnessed is what’s known as an ‘electromagnetic pulse’, or EMP</font>.
  Perhaps some wicked genius detonated an EMP-weapon high up in the atmosphere.
  Or perhaps some star violently exploded nearby.&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3"> Whatever the cause, the effect
  is the same: the atmosphere is flooded with exceptionally highly
  charged light particles, called photons. The photons smash into the atoms that
  make up the atmosphere, and knock out their electrons. That’s the flash of
  light you see: suddenly, a HUGE cloud of electrons comes surging down, much
  like a ridiculously large bolt of lightning. The electrons demolish everything
  electric. Everything with circuitry or wiring in it, turns into a foul-reeking
  porridge of molten plastic and short-circuited wires.</font></p>

          <p align="center"><img border="0" src="bd14868_.gif" width="12" height="12"> <font color="#FFFF00" face="MS Sans Serif" size="2"><b>Poor
          Man's Doomsday Weapon?</b> - There is some concern terrorists may
          disrupt the West, using a very large electromagnetic pulse bomb.
          Indeed, EMP weapons are cheap to make. But don't get paranoid:
          you'd have to be one goofy whiz kid terrorist to achieve it. Oh, and
          what they don't tell you, is that the only country that has used
          e-bombs in combat already, is the US. During the war in Iraq, the US
          Army dropped several small e-bombs on power stations and television
          stations. That worked.</font></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">Indeed, EMP’s can
  be that nasty. The calculations show that a large enough EMP going off high in the
  atmosphere should be able to knock out every machine in Europe or the US. If a
  large stellar explosion flooded the atmosphere with super-charged photons, it
  could even get worse. The dreaded machine-killer may even affect half of the
  globe -- and all of mankind.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3"><font color="#FF9900">It’s
  difficult to tell what will happen next.</font> With luck, some machines
  will survive. Devices running on batteries or machines that were turned off
  during the blast, have a far better chance of survival.&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3"> And of course, diesel
  engines and steam-powered machines won't be affected -- although you may be
  unable to operate them, without the electrical circuitry that’s usually needed to
  run them. For transport, you may want to use a horse or a bicycle (with no
  light). And
  you may be relieved to find that your hammer, screwdriver and other basic
  working tools are still in tip-top condition. At least, you can try to build
  up society again by hand.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">So in the end, we
  should survive -- but not without a terrible crisis. Just read how one of our readers cozily puts it:</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">&quot;</font><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">We
  will have no food. We will have no clothing. We will have no access to the
  information needed to make that food and that clothing. The ending will be
  sudden and complete. If air systems are needed, the deaths will come in
  minutes. If water is needed, deaths will come in agonizing days. If food is
  needed, death will pay a visit only after several excruciating weeks. People
  escaping the clutches of the Machine will not be able to cope with an
  environment that doesn't pamper them anymore. They will die clutching the
  remotes that used to make the Machine do what they wanted and needed. They
  will die hungry, thirsty, filthy and cold.&quot;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" color="#FFFF00" size="4">Bomb
  or bug?</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">We don't really know
  how big the danger is. We've only had electric wiring for a mere 150 years - a
  tiny fraction of the planet's history. No one knows how many times the Earth
  has been hit by immense EMP's from outer space already.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3"><font color="#FF9900">And
  come
  to think of it, it gets worse.</font> A large EMP isn’t the only
  thing that is capable of shutting down our machines. Perhaps, a simple
  technical failure can do the trick, too. </font><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">That’s less silly
  than it sounds. We live in an ever more connected world, with ever more
  connected machines. This makes us vulnerable to power failures, computer bugs,
  system malfunctions
  -- stuff like that.&nbsp;</font></p>

  </div>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3"> Take the infamous Northeast Blackout of 2003. No less than
  50 million people in the US and Canada found themselves without electricity.
  And the cause? For crying out loud, it was a humble tree that gently touched
  some power lines in Canada! Now that’s encouraging. If something as simple
  as a tree can put 50 million people in the dark...</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3"><font color="#FF9900">Or
  consider the Millennium Bug.</font> No one will ever know what would have
  happened if computer experts hadn’t taken precautions. But the forecasts
  were bad: on 1/1/2000, computer systems would go berserk. Bank accounts would
  empty themselves, data bases be lost, power stations would fail, nuclear
  missiles would decide to launch themselves. Gladly, all of this didn’t
  happen. But what if someone released a computer virus which, say, told
  our computers it’s the year 3000?</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">As our reader puts
  it: &quot;That automation is coming, and coming fast. Home automation is here
  already (albeit pricey and unreliable for now) and will improve by leaps and
  bounds quickly. Internet-connected everythings are being sold everywhere.
  We're even taking baby steps into fully-automated factories and
  fully-automated transportation systems. (You really don't want to know how
  planes are guided these days.) And sometime within the next century the
  turning point will come. We will become so dependent upon the Machine that its
  absence will kill us.&quot;</font></p>
