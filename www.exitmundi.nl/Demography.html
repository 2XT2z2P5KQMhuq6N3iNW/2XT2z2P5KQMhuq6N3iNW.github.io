<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial" size="3">Here
  are the figures. By the year 2100, 83 percent of all Spaniards will be gone.
  There will be 86 percent less Italians, while in Germany, only 17 percent of
  the population will be left. And how about this one: three generations from
  now, there will only be half as many people than today.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">The doing of some kind of virus or
  climate mishap? Far from it. This time, the extinction goes all by
  itself.&nbsp; </font><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial" size="3">`Demographic
  meltdown’, is what they call it. Or `birth collapse’. Or `baby bust’.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial" size="3">It goes
  like this. On average, a couple should have at least two children to ensure
  the continuation of the species – or more precise: 2,1,
  to compensate for children that die early. But all over the world, couples
  decide to have fewer children. From 2050 on, this will cause the world’s
  population to shrink. And shrink, until there may be no one left.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial" size="3"><font color="#FF9900">So why on
  earth would humanity want to do that?</font> The reasons are manifold. And in fact,
  quite understandable. In the old days, you needed children to work on your
  farm, and to look after you when you grew old. You needed lots of them,
  because many children died young.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial" size="3">But with
  better health care and with social security, that’s all changed. You don't
  really <i>need </i>children anymore. What's more, when you
  live in a city, children cost you time and money. Besides, more and more
  women work. They’ll have children at a later age and bear fewer
  children – if they decide to have any children at all, that is.
  Anti-conception has nothing to do with it. A religious lifestyle doesn't stop
  the trend either. It’s just the course of history
  that’s doing us in.<img border="0" src="demographyplaat.gif" width="156" height="173" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5"></font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial" size="3">Not impressed yet? Please
  let us throw some more figures at you.
  At this very moment moment, the populations of over sixty countries are
  falling. Fifty years ago, women throughout the world on average had five
  children. Today, the average has diminished to 2,7 kids. And all the experts
  agree on one thing: that’s just the beginning.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial" size="3"><font color="#FF9900">Obviously,
  this will change the world we live in completely.</font> Expect a world where
  everybody’s ageing and youngsters and children are becoming rare. Expect
  empty streets, and empty stores. Expect the world economy to come to a
  grinding halt, as there are less and less people around to buy stuff. Expect
  governments urging their people to have children, for heaven’s sake, please
  do! Expect a world where every country is begging third world immigrants and
  refugees to come over.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial" size="3">But then
  again, no immigrant would come. The statistics show that the baby bust also strikes in the poorer half
  of the globe. In Asia and China, birth rates are falling alarmingly fast. In the Southern
  Americas – the same story. Africa is the only continent where the birth
  numbers are still high. But then again, the AIDS epidemic causes people to die
  at an early age – and this actually is slowing down population growth
  tremendously.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#FFFF00">Oomph oomph</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial" size="3">That’s
  neat, you say. So we’re about to join the Woolly Mammoth. Exactly the sort
  of thing you wanted to hear when you thought to relax a bit while surfing the
  web, right?</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial" size="3">Well,
  here’s something to cheer you up a little. In fact, it’s very hard to say
  if the baby bust that’s hitting us today will actually bring about the end
  of the species. With six billion people around today, we don’t exactly have
  to wet our pants yet. And then there’s this: 70,000 years ago, when humanity
  was still wearing bear skins and saying ‘oomph, oomph’, humankind also
  survived near-extinction. Back then, a <a href="volcano.html"> supervolcano</a> erupted and cut humanity
  down to a slim total of 10,000. But we survived all of that.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial" size="3"><font color="#FF9900">On the
  other hand, there’s absolutely no indication the trend will change.</font> With
  fewer and fewer people around, women will be under even greater pressure to
  find a job – and have even less children. We can be sure about one thing:
  women will never ever again voluntarily have themselves locked away in their
  role as child-attendee and kitchen maid.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial" size="3">And then
  there is this other nagging problem. As explained <a href="Sperm%20problem.html"> elsewhere</a> on this site,
  there is a possibility men are becoming less fertile. Just picture it: a world where women don’t <i>want</i> to have
  children, and men just <i>can’t</i>. </font></span><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial" size="3"> Now
  wouldn't that be a pity?&nbsp;</font></span></p>
