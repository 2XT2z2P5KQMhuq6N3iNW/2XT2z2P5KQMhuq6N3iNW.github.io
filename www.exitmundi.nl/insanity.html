  can fly, shooting each other up for fun, or stepping in front of trains

  </div>But actually, the
  nutcase scenario is not that idiotic. It got high marks on a dead-serious
  ranking of what can go wrong with the world, published once by the popular
  science magazine Discover. Indeed, there’s some quite serious evidence
  we’re heading for total insanity. We’re a more mentally deranged species
  than ever. And we’re going crazier all the time, the figures show.
  Depression, anxiety, eating disorders – they’re all on the rise.</font></span>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font color="#FF9900"><font face="Arial">Just
  look at</font></font><font face="Arial"><font color="#FF9900"> the figures.</font>
  An estimated six percent of all men and ten percent of all women suffer from
  depression. Ten to twenty percent of all kids have some kind of mental illness
  or behavioral disorder. In the US alone, something like 20 million people
  suffer from some kind of anxiety disorder. And that’s not everything. The
  World Health Organization expects that by 2020, depression will be the second
  major cause of disability, right after heart diseases. `Have we entered the
  age of misery and melancholy?’, the Canadian <i>Journal Of Psychiatry</i>
  asked in an editorial.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial">Sounds hefty,
  right? Fortunately, there’s also a lot to be held <i>against </i>the
  figures. With ever more people on the planet, it’s only normal the number of
  mentally ill should rise too. But way more important, the nutcase number is
  climbing because of the way we deal with them. Not too long ago, nobody
  thought anything of it when you went crazy. You just had to cope with it
  yourself. And if your mental mishap was too conspicuous, well, they simply
  locked you away.<img border="0" src="insane1.gif" align="right" hspace="6" width="192" height="229" vspace="4"></font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial"><font color="#FF9900">Nowadays,
  that’s all changed. </font>There are treatments for all kinds of mental
  inconveniences, ranging from mild depressions to fear of the dentist. In fact,
  because of the revolution in psychiatric science, there’s a `syndrome’ for
  all kinds of behavior – even the more normal ones. Drinking, having sex,
  smoking, using marijuana, breaking the speed limit with your car, surfing the
  internet, being single – our shrinks label all these things as `problems’,
  mental abnormalities that shouldn’t be there.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial">The World Health
  Organization is no exception. Under their `mental and neurological
  disorders’ they also list smoking tobacco and marijuana, epilepsy and
  drinking alcohol. Think of smoking and drinking what you will – but is it
  the same as believing you're an airplane?</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial">Let’s face it. In
  a way, our shrinks are driving us crazy. Or am I being neurotic, paranoid,
  schizoid, over-aggressive and narcistic to say these things? Hmm, I probably
  should go see a shrink.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial"><font color="#FF9900">But
  wait a sec.</font> All that said, the prospect of humanity ending up totally
  wacko is actually very likely. You read that right: <b>very likely</b>!<i> </i>It
  doesn’t have anything to do with shrinks – but with basic biology.<img border="0" src="insane2.gif" align="left" width="101" height="107" hspace="8" vspace="4"></font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial">Suppose one of the
  catastrophes outlined on this site one day really happens. Suppose there’s a
  <a href="Comets.html">meteor</a>, a <a href="nukes.html">nuclear war</a>, a <a href="volcano.html">supervolcano</a>
  or an <a href="Iceage.html">all-out ice age</a>. Humanity will be swept away,
  with only a few pockets of humans surviving. To reproduce, they’ll have to
  inbreed. And if a small group of people inbreed, the species will, after a
  generation or two, start going sour. They will be malformed, and especially
  their minds will be severely twisted. It’s just nature’s way of saying:
  there’s too little of you, you’d better go extinct altogether.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial">So in the end, if
  disaster strikes, mental retardedness is indeed the most likely prospect for
  the survivors. The last humans on earth will indeed run around, flap their
  arms and pretend they’re Superman.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial">Well, look at it
  from the bright side. At least, we’ll have a lot of outrageous fun before we
  go out!</font></span></p>
