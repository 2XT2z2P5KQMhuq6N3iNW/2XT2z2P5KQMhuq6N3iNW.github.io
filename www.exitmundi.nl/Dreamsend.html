  </div>It has to do with the stuff
most people find boring in school: the laws of physics. Ultimately, all of
these laws are founded upon the ‘physical constants’. Such as the force of
gravity, the ‘strong force’ that glues atomic nuclei together and the
electromagnetic force, the driving hand behind stuff like lightning and
computers. But why do these fundamental ‘presets’ have the values they have?
Why aren’t they a little bigger, or smaller?<br style='mso-special-character:

Fred Hoyle was the first to realise this is no coincidence. A very peculiar
thing about the fundamental constants is that they appear to have <i>exactly </i>the
right values. If they were slightly smaller or bigger, atoms, stars, planets
and people simply wouldn’t exist!<br>
<br>
Take the strong force
inside atomic nuclei. If the force were just slightly stronger, it would boost
up the burning of stars so much, that they would explode only seconds after
they were formed. We wouldn’t have a sun – or even a planet. If on the other
hand the force were a tad weaker, it would be too weak to hold together
elements like the heavy hydrogen isotope deuterium. Stars wouldn’t light up.
And we wouldn’t be here either.<br>

the stuff our Universe is made of isn’t very real at all. Sure, you can feel
the chair underneath you, and see the monitor in front of you. But what we feel
and touch and see in everyday life is actually a manifestation of some deeper,
completely different kind of underlying reality.<br>
<br>
One way to explore what matter is, is to take it apart. First, you’ll find tiny
chunks of matter that are called molecules. Then, if you take the molecules
apart, you’ll find the atoms the molecules are made of. And then, if you take
apart the atoms, you’ll see it’s made of a nucleus, surrounded by a cloud of<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>electrons. And what if you take apart that
nucleus? You’ll be in for a big surprise. For inside an atom’s nucleus, reality
as we know it actually ceases to exist.<br style='mso-special-character:line-break'>

of a better word. When you say ‘particles’, you think of little balls. But in
quantum physics, there’s no such thing as solid `balls’ you can touch or see.<br>
<br>
In fact, ‘particles’ like quarks, electrons and photons are so incredibly and
utterly different from everything we know of, our language lacks the words to
describe them. Particles can be in two places at the same time, and behave both
like a wave and a tiny chunk of matter, depending on what you do with them.
Particles can pop in and out of existence from nowhere. And ‘grabbing’ them is
impossible: it is simply not possible to both know where a particle is and how
fast it moves about.<br style='mso-special-character:line-break'>

particles are the vibrations of the strings. They are the music the strings make.<br

Once more, the real story is far stranger than that. For starters, the Universe
has no ‘outside’. To ask what is ‘outside’ the Universe is a meaningless
question – it would be like asking what continent lies ‘outside’ our planet.
‘Outside’ the Universe there are no dimensions, and there is no time. The
Universe is best seen as an expanding bubble of dimensions in a sea of
nothingness – although ‘nothing’ isn’t really a word you can use to describe
what is ‘outside’ the Universe.</span><!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shapetype id="_x0000_t75"

doing it again: you’re picturing a place with bubbles floating around. But

And it goes even further. For in fact, it could actually be possible to create
a Universe! Basically, the only thing you’d have to do is squeeze a huge amount
of energy together into a very dense, small spot. This would lead to a Big
Bang, the theories predict. We wouldn’t see it happening: the Big Bang would
create a new dimensional bubble, far beyond reach of our own bubble.<br>

OK, let’s pause for a second. Just think about it. Is it possible that our

believe there is something like a ‘soul’ or a ‘spirit’ living inside of you.
But when it comes down to facts, there just isn’t any evidence for that. Every
thought you have, every move you make, every emotion you feel - it’s just
brain, brain, brain.<br>

actually experiments that <i>prove</i> it. </span><span style='font-family:
Arial'>When you disturb your brain in a certain way, your feeling of ‘self’ can
get detached from your brain. Suddenly, it will feel as if ‘you’ are not inside
your body anymore. You experience what is known as an ‘out of body experience’,
or a ‘near death experience’.<br>
<br>
But you don’t have to be nearly dead to feel it. The sensation can easily be
created in a laboratory, by placing a helmet with rotating magnetic fields on
your head. The magnetic field acts like a ‘jam signal’ on your brain. Suddenly,
you'll feel like you're floating outside your body. But you aren’t. It’s just
your brain going confused.<br style='mso-special-character:line-break'>
<![if !supportLineBreakNewLine]><br style='mso-special-character:line-break'>
<![endif]></span><span style='font-family:Arial'>And you don't really
need a helmet to do the trick. Visiting a place where the movement of the
Earth's crust generates magnetic fields can give you the experience. Being in a
situation where your brain doesn't get enough oxygen sometimes does it. Certain
brain operations bring out the experience. Meditation and intensive prayer can
generate it.<br>

exactly this is why some people see ghosts, or Maria</span><span
style='font-family:Arial'>, or feel like they are visited by aliens. It is an
incredible weird experience to be ‘outside of your brain’. Your brain will try
to make sense of it. Immediately, the rational part of your brain will come up
with an ‘explanation’ for the experience. You will sense a ‘presence’ near you.
If you’re religious, you might see Maria, or Jesus. If you believe in UFOs,
your brain might tell you you’re visited by aliens. If you believe in ghosts,
you’ll feel the presence of a ghost of a dead person. But in reality, it’s your
own feeling of self you’re experiencing.<br>

know. Could be almost anything, really. A dream, even. Or a simulation. Or a
kind of computer game, an advanced kind of <i>Civilization </i>or <i>Sims. </i>There’s
no way of knowing if there’s someone or something pushing the buttons. There’s

other thing most theorists agree on: our reality could suddenly <i>end</i>. Our
universe could fold up. The dimensions we live in could be wrapped up. The very
fabric of our physical world could be disrupted by some unprecedented, weird
physical event. From one second to the other, our reality would no longer be
there. Sounds like fun, right?<br>

again, why bother?</span><span style='font-family:Arial'> For that’s the deeper
consequence of these things. If there is no such thing as a place we call
Earth, we needn’t really worry about its end. Would the characters of a
Sims-game feel sad or disappointed when you turned off the computer? Or would
the people you dream of at night mind if you wake up? You guessed it: they
probably wouldn't. What isn’t really there, doesn’t really end.<br>
