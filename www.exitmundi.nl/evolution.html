    could take several decades, or perhaps many thousands of years. But we can
    be sure of one thing: sooner or later, the human race as we know it will no
    longer be here. Don't panic, it's just good old evolution that's doing us
    in. Humanity will go extinct -- but who would care?</font></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif">We'll admit it - we've been
  fooling you. When we talked of distant stuff like <a href="Sunburn.html">the
  Sun's death</a>, or <a href="Nemesis.html">the homecoming of Nemesis</a>, we
  pretended that there will still be people around in the distant future, just
  like today.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Well, forget it. Whatever inhabits the planet in several millions of years -- it won't be
  humans. The human race will have been
  replaced by... well, something else.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">It's
  easy to see why.</font>  There's plenty of evidence we are still evolving. Europeans are
  getting taller. Northern Europeans are becoming more resistant to disease. And
  although it's controversial, there's some evidence we're getting smarter.</font></p>

  </div>Our limbs have become feebler. Our bodies are
  getting stiffer, and less agile. Our senses, and especially our nose, have
  deteriorated big time. There's evidence our <a href="Sperm%20problem.html"> sperm is getting
  worse</a>. Our jaws
  and teeth have decayed over time (that's why we need constant dental care).</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif">That's because evolution is not about improving living things -- but simply,
  about adapting to the circumstances. And we're adapted to walking, and
  thinking, and working with our hands. The cost is that
  we have become lousy tree-swingers, and bad monkeys. Try eating a banana using only your feet,
  and you'll see what we mean.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Where will this take us in
  another million years? Nobody knows! It all depends on the circumstances.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Perhaps our brains will continue to grow,
  giving us ridiculous, enormous heads. Perhaps our planet will one day be
  inhabited by sentient brains sitting in a wheelchair, who knows?</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">But evolution
  could also demolish us.</font> Say for
  some reason we are forced to live underground. This could, in theory, yield a
  humankind with no eyes! This is what happened to certain species of
  cave-dwelling fish.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif">And it could get worse.
  Suppose a deadly disease broke out. Now, suppose there was a only people
  genetically fit to fight off the disease, are pe</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Experts agree on one thing,
  though. Our kind could transform a lot quicker than you think. We're already
  tinkering with the evolution of our species, for example by healing the sick.
  And that's just the beginning. Roughly speaking, there are two trends here:
  technology and gene tinkering.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" color="#FFFF00" size="4">1.
  Technology</font></p>
  <div align="right">
    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="151" align="right">
      <tr>
        <td width="100%"><img border="0" src="fembot.jpg" width="151" height="234"></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Already, we are stuffing up
  our bodies with all kinds of goodies: artificial limbs and organs, plastic
  heart valves, titanium joints, contact lenses, hearing aides -- you name it.
  And no doubt we will continue to replace body parts with high tech gadgets.
  Already, scientists are experimenting with brain implants that help or even
  replace part of your brain!</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Futurologists expect we will
  one day upgrade our minds with chips that boost our brain power, or even
  upload our mind to a computer. Or we would replace our vulnerable organs at
  birth, just to be sure.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif">So, how's that for evolution.
  In a few decades, we may have got to the point where we are no longer humans
  -- but machines. As astronomer Seth Shostak likes to put it: &quot;You can
  improve horses by putting four-cylinder engines in them. But eventually, you
  can do without the horse part.&quot;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" color="#FFFF00" size="4">2.
  Genes</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Or we could upgrade our DNA.<br>
  <br>
  At this very moment, we're entering the age of genetic modification. Already,
  we're upgrading the DNA of certain plants and animals -- and we, humans, are
  next. We're about to improve our genetic code,
  just like you would upgrade an outdated piece of computer software.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif">At first, this will lead to
  new cures for certain diseases. We will teach our DNA to fight off hereditary
  conditions, and in the longer run, viral infections and cancer. But it should
  also be possible to actually improve our bodies. Sportsmen will instruct their
  DNA to make more muscles, a feat already accomplished in animals. Others will
  tweak their DNA in order to lengthen their lives, or to become smarter.&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">Ultimately,
  the sky is the limit.</font> Want bigger brains? Healthier organs? Bigger
  penises, larger breasts? Just tell your DNA to make it so. And hey, think big!
  Why not grow yourself wings, enhance your vision or make your body solar powered, so you can do without food?</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif">In principle, it's all
  possible. Just think of our bodies as computers, the DNA being its software.
  We're about to upload software from other species. Almost every trick nature
  has ever programmed into DNA software in other species, could be running on
  our bodies soon. It's Mother Nature's freeware!</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">
  So,
  where will it take our species?</font> Our guess would be: to a point where
  humans are no longer human. Scholars expect 'Numans', 'Transhumans', 'Unihumans',
  'Astrans' -- and lots of other shiny sci-fi words. It will be the end of
  mankind. But with some luck, it will at least be a happy end!<br>
