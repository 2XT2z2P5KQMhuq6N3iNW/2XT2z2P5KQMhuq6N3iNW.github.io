  </div>If only the Vikings
  knew. Today, hundreds of years after the Vikings roamed the coasts of northern
  Europe, the Nordish word ‘Ragnarok’ gives you more than two million hits
  on Google. ‘Ragnarok’ is a word from Tolkien. It is a computer game. A
  card game. A rock band. An opera. And much, much more.</font><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3"><o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">But who knows, one of
  these days, the REAL Ragnarok might unfold. Ragnarok means ‘fate of the
  gods’. It is the Viking version of the Apocalypse. Believe us: you don’t
  want to be around when it happens.</font><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3"><o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3"><font color="#FF9900">It
  all starts with a winter that just won’t stop. </font>For three years in a
  row, summer doesn’t come. All there is, is this harsh, terrible winter. It
  is freezing cold, so you stay indoors, and get bad-tempered. As a consequence,
  all kinds of arguments break out among men, even within the closest families.
  Morality and mutual respect seem to break down. In case you’re interested:
  what you’re witnessing is the ‘Fimbulwinter’, the first clear sign the
  world is about to end.</font><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3"><o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">Now, brace yourself.
  You’re going to witness the first in a series of HUGE apocalyptic surprises.
  For what on Earth is that? Suddenly, you see a huge wolf flying overhead. It<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>flies across the sky, like some weird kind of airplane. That, my
  friend, is the mythical wolf Skoll. And before you know what’s happening, it
  eats up the Sun. And wait -- there goes the moon, too!<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3"><font color="#FF9900">From
  that moment on, it gets crazier and crazier.</font> The ground starts to
  shudder. Trees are launched, even complete mountains fall over. And then,
  suddenly, you see this outlandishly dressed guy emerging out of nowhere. It is
  Loki, supreme bad guy for the Vikings. He is set free by the earthquakes --
  and ready to pick a fight.</font><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3"><o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">Loki is not alone.
  Next to him, you see another supernatural wolf. It’s Loki’s son, Fenrir.
  The beast has a HUGE mouth: its lower jaw scrapes the ground, while the upper
  jaw touches the sky.</font><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3"><o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">Right after that, you
  hear a sharp, screeching sound. Could that be… a cock crowing? Yes: it is.
  In fact, there are three of them. Cock number one, a red animal, crows to the
  giants. Cock number two, a golden bird, calls in the gods. And cock number
  three, a rusty brown animal, raises the dead from hell.</font><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3"><o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3"><font color="#FF9900"><img border="0" src="raganrok-metwolf.jpg" width="171" height="239" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="6">You
  rub your eyes. This can’t be happening, you keep telling yourself.</font>
  But it is. Next thing you know, the sea starts to roar violently. There’s a
  colossal tsunami, and then, the next bad guy enters the stage. A gargantuan
  serpent rises out of the sea. It is Jormungand, a venomous snake out of hell.</font><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3"><o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">From that moment on,
  things go from bad to worse. Everywhere around the globe, all kinds of gods
  and beasts and demons and giants start showing up. Some come in ships, others
  on horseback, still others come walking. They’re all heavily armed, with
  divine swords, magical spears, and all kinds of other supernatural stuff. And
  they seem to be in a bad mood.</font><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3"><o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">Now, if you happen to
  live in Norway, better take shelter. For Norway is where all these weird
  creatures are heading. That’s where the final battle is to be fought, on a
  battlefield called Vigrid.</font><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3"><o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3"><font color="#FF9900">In
  total amazement, you watch on TV what’s unfolding. </font>From the east
  comes the huge sailing ship Naglfar, commanded by the giant Hymir. Look, there
  comes Loki again, aboard another huge boat, full of demons he brought in from
  hell. From the south comes Surt, another sinister warrior leading an army of
  giants. Don’t try to talk him out of it: he’ll instantly incinerate you
  with his mighty sword, which is as hot as the Sun itself. Carelessly, Surt
  turns every city he passes into a smoking rubble.</font><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3"><o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">And there’s more to
  come. In the south, people witness how a fierce hell hound named Garm rushes
  in to team up with the fire giants. In the meantime, you won’t be able get a
  night’s rest: the pitch-black sky is filled with eerie woes, explosions and
  echoes. Why do these apocalypses always come with all of these special
  effects?</font><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3"><o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">On the battlefield,
  one lonely god hangs around. It’s the good Viking god named Heimdall. And
  when he sees all these giants and demons and beasts approaching, he picks up
  his horn and blows it, to wake up the gods. It will be some sound: it is heard
  throughout the entire world.</font><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3"><o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3"><font color="#FF9900">So:
  the gods wake up.</font> There’s Odin, and Thor, and all the others. What do
  they do? Well: they sit down, have a few drinks and have a meeting.</font><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3"><o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></p>

      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">On Earth, we will of
  course not notice this. What we do notice, is another weird apocalyptic event.
  You may not know this, but somewhere in heaven, there’s a very special tree
  called Yggdrasil. It is the Tree of the World, the living embodiment of
  everything and everyone that ever was and ever will be on this planet. And
  now, Yggdrasil shivers. From its deepest root up to its highest branches, it
  shakes. You should feel this shaking from deep within: it is your very
  existence itself, that shivers. Everything on Earth and in heaven and hell
  will quiver, the Viking legends foresee.</font><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3"><o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">Meanwhile, the gods
  finally arrive at the battlefield. They look exactly as you would expect them
  to: dressed in shiny, golden armor, and riding beautiful white horses. The
  upper god Odin rides at the head.</font><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3"><o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">Then, it’s battle
  time. It goes something like this:</font><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3"><o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3"><font color="#FF9900">Odin
  jumps Fenrir</font>, while Thor is attacked by Jormungand and Freyr clashes
  with Surt, but unfortunately Freyr gave his sword to Skirnir, so Surt wins,
  while Tyr kills Garm but then dies himself, just like Heimdall and Loki fight
  each other to death and Thor dies after killing Jormungand with his hammer
  Mjollnir, while Odin is eaten by Fenrir, after which Vidar gets so pissed off
  he kills Fenrir by tearing off its head, which annoys Surt so much he sets the
  entire world on fire, killing everyone else.<br>
  <br>
  And after that, all land sinks into the sea. Finally, it gets quiet.</font><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3"><o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">So, exit mankind? And
  bye-bye gods? Not quite. Miraculously, a few gods survive. And fortunately,
  they belong to the good guys: Odin’s brother and sons Vili, Vali and Vidar,
  Thor’s sons Magni and Modi and a few other blokes, named Honir, Balder and
  Hod. Even more miraculously, two people survive. They’re named Lif and
  Lifthrasir -- the Viking version of Adam and Eve, so to say. They have endured
  the events by hiding deep within the tree Yggdrasil.</font><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">And it
  gets better. After a while, up rises an entire new world from the sea. It’s
  a heavenly place, with lush fields and plenty of corn waiting to be harvested.
  The Sun is reborn, and so is the moon. Balder takes it on him to lead the gods
  of this new world, and Lif and Lifthrasir worship Balder and his gods.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3"><img border="0" src="ragnarok2.jpg" width="435" height="123" align="middle"></font><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3"><o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3"><font color="#FF9900">Slowly,
  the world is repopulated</font> by the descendents of Lif and Lifthrasir.
  Fortunately for them, World No. 2 is a much better place than our current
  world ever was. For one thing, evil no longer exists. There will be no
  sword-fighting, no nit-picking, gossiping, cheating, stealing, killing or
  breaking the speed limit with your car. Finally, mankind will live in complete
  and utter harmony.</font><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3"><o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">It’s a pity you
  won’t be there to join in. According to the ancient Viking writings called
  the Edda, which describe all these events, you will have died in the fire
  unleashed by Surt. Or, if you somehow managed to survive that, you would have
  drowned in the big sinking of all land afterwards.</font><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3"><o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3"><font color="#FF9900">But
  even then, your soul still exists.</font> By now, you should find yourself in
  the renewed, totally reconstructed Viking heaven. There are many rooms there,
  and their quality varies wildly. If you’re very lucky, you get to live with
  the gods in a place called Gimli, which is a huge, sunlit building with a
  golden roof. Or you might find yourself in Brimir, another beautiful place
  with drinks galore.</font><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3"><o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">But on the other
  hand, if you behaved badly during life, you could end up in a dark hole called
  Nastrond. That means ‘corpse strand’, a description that pretty much says
  it all. Nastrond is a dark dungeon, with walls and roofs made of snakes. You
  will have to wade through a river of venom for eternity.</font><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3"><o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3"><font color="#FF9900">No
  offense to the Vikings</font>, but somehow we at Exit Mundi have some doubts
  about the reality of Ragnarok. It seems to be just what it is: a Viking myth.
  Not too many people believe in it anymore -- if there are any people who still
  take it literally, that is.</font><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3"><o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">On the other hand,
  plenty of modern day people seriously accept the idea that one day, the world
  will be terminated by four horsemen and a horde of huge locusts from a pit.
  That, at least, is how it goes in the Christian end of times, the Apocalypse
  of St. John.</font><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3"><o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></p>
  <span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">So
  who is right? Who is wrong? Guess we’ll just have to sit back, and wait. But
  should<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>that terrible winter come
  -- better hide in that tree!</font></span>
