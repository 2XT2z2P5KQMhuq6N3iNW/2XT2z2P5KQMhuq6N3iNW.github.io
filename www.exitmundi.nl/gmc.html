  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 12.0pt; mso-hyphenate: none" align="center"><span lang="EN-US" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font size="4" color="#FF9900">The
  Universe is a dangerous place. There are black holes, and sudden explosions, and
  meteors flying around everywhere. But hey, that's not all. Something so
  ordinary like a cloud may one day do us in as well.</font><o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;mso-hyphenate:

  course, the Doomsday Cloud that will bring about the end of the world is quite different from those puny pieces
  of wadding you see up in the sky every day. Our cloud of doom is a bit bigger
  than that. It would take our planet something like <b>one million years</b> to pass
  through it. That's why scientists refer to the thing as a <b>`Giant Molecular
  Cloud'</b> - `giant' being no understatement for a cloud that's several light
  years across.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;mso-hyphenate:
none"><span lang="EN-US" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif">In
  the emptiness of the Cosmos, Giant Molecular Clouds are nothing special. Giant Molecular Clouds are, in fact,
  stars in the making. First, there's a cosmic cloud of dust and gas; next,
  gravity presses the
  cloud together -- and finally, there's a bunch of stars lighting up. In fact, our own Sun
  started out as a cosmic cloud, too.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;mso-hyphenate:
none"><span lang="EN-US" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">But
  what harm can something so utterly boring like a cloud really do?</font>, you may ask.
  Well, for one thing, space clouds have the rather nasty habit of choking the life
  out of every planet they swallow. According to some scientists, it was a cosmic
  cloud, and not a comet, that did in those poor old dinosaurs!</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;mso-hyphenate:
none"><span lang="EN-US" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Giant
  Molecular Clouds have a reputation for messing up the atmosphere of each
  Earth-like planet they encounter. When our planet passes one,
  dust from the GMC will block the Sun. The Sun would become a vague blot of
  light in the sky. In no time, a spine chilling <a href="Iceage.html">Ice Age</a>
  would break out.<o:p></o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;mso-hyphenate:
none"><span lang="EN-US" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Oh,
  big deal, so you turn up the heating. But wait -- that was
  just the beginning.<br>
  <br>
  Apart from dust, Giant Molecular Clouds typically consist
  of huge amounts of hydrogen. Loads of it would penetrate our atmosphere. Once
  there, the hydrogen would start mopping up oxygen atoms, combining them into
  water. Surely, this would bring about a lot of rain (as you might expect from
  a cloud). But what's worse, with the planet's oxygen level dropping, breathing would become hard -- if not
  impossible.<o:p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;mso-hyphenate:
none"><span lang="EN-US" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">And the Doomsday Cloud
  isn't finished yet.</font> Since the thing
  consists of soot and dust, it has gravity. Consequently, it will attract
  millions and millions of cosmic rocks and meteorites from the outer regions of the
  solar system. Planet sized chunks of stone and ice will come flying in from all directions. Some will <a href="Kuiperbelt.html">explode and block the Sun</a>
  even more; others will just hang around a bit or, well, <a href="Comets.html">impact</a>
  on Earth.</font></span></p>

  oxygen shortage, floods, <a href="volcano.html">volcanoes</a> -- you name it,
  it's all there. Once smothered in a space cloud, we would find our planet harassed by every weird
  and violent natural phenomenon you can think of. For hundreds of thousands of
  years in a row, Earth would be a complete mess, a mayhem of meteoric impacts,
  blackened Suns, climate shifts and cataclysmic floods not unlike what Saint

          is ten million miles wide, is made of burning acid, has a black hole

          <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="2" color="#FFFF00">It
          is the 'chaos cloud', my friends. This infamous bulb of misery is due
          to arrive on June 1<sup>st</sup>, 2014. And it merciless dissolves
          everything it encounters: comets, planets, even entire stars. Well, or
          so they say.</font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="2" color="#FFFF00">If
          you have never heard of the chaos cloud, don't worry. Neither had we.
          That was, until <a href="http://tv.yahoo.com/news/wwn/20050912/112653720013.html" target="_blank">the
          object popped up on Yahoo news</a> -- in the subdirectory
          'entertainment', of all places. According to the news clipping, the
          cloud was discovered on April 6th by NASA-scientists working with the
          Chandra X-Ray Observatory. Upon discovery, NASA decided to keep it a
          secret. Or so at least claims one dr. Albert Sherwinski, a Cambridge
          based astrophysicist.</font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="2" color="#FFFF00">Of
          course, the news is fake. It's a joke. It originally appeared in the
          magazine <a href="http://www.weeklyworldnews.com/features/science/">Weekly
          World News</a>, a magazine full of pranks and fake news. There, it is
          listed among headlines like 'Scientists find women's
          asking-for-directions gene' and 'Nuclear rocket fired at UFO'.</font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="2" color="#FFFF00">To
          be sure, we ran a few checks. Lo and behold: there is no
          astrophysicist by the name of Albert Sherwinski. What's more, we
          should see the cloud with the naked eye by now (and we don't). And oh,
          a minor detail: in space, burning acid clouds revolving around black
          holes simply don't exist.</font></td>
