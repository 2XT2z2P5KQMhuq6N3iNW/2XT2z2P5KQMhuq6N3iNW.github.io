<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="4" color="#FF9900">&quot;Resistance
    is futile&quot;. If you’re a Star Trek fan, hearing those words probably
    immediately triggers one thought: the Borg. The Borg is the ultimate
    nightmare: humanity, enslaved by a computer. Luckily, it is only fiction. Or
    is it?</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3"><br>
  In Star Trek, they come in a cube. A huge space ship it is, filled with
  millions of people. Well -- they’re not really people. They are the Borg.
  The people in the cube have no free will, no mind of their own. They are One.
  They’re plugged into the mainframe computer called ‘the Borg’. They’re cyber slaves.
  Poor little creatures.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">But that’s science
  fiction, right? Not so. In fact, as we speak, the Borg is lurking just around
  the corner, waiting for its chance. It won’t come in a cube from outer space
  though, but from the very place you’re on right now: the Internet. And if it
  comes, resistance will, indeed, be futile.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">The
  signs are disturbing.</font> Let’s do a little experiment. Please, find out
  what ‘auparishtaka’ is.</font></p>

    </table>
  </div><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Done that?</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Ok, all of you readers have
  probably followed exactly the same routine. You’ve opened Google and entered
  ‘auparishtaka’. All of you will have found
  the same search results. You will have visited the same websites. Have
  absorbed the same information. For a very brief and fleeting
  moment, you were One.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Silly example, you snort.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif">But hold on -- that was just
  to warm you up a little. The real stuff is yet to come. Brace yourself: w</font><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">hat you are about to
  read, could change the way you see your humble computer and the Internet
  forever.<br>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" color="#FFFF00" size="4">One:
  We are being cyborged</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3"> Already, there are
  many experiments with simple implants being inserted into people’s brains.
  Most of them are there for our health: the implants bring back (some) hearing
  or even some eyesight, or cure you from terrible conditions like depressions
  or extreme phobia’s.&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">But some implants have a more ‘luxurious’ function. They connect to
  your brain in order to make you move your artificial limb, if you happen to be
  missing one. Or they make you control the cursor of your computer by mind
  control, if you’re paralyzed.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3"><img border="0" src="borg3.jpg" width="267" height="212" align="left" hspace="2" vspace="4"><font color="#FF9900">Most
  experts agree that that's just the beginning.</font> Eventually, we will see more
  and more implants. Need to learn Greek? Just have a cyber doctor
  plug a tiny chip into your brain, much like a memory stick. Want better eyesight? The doc will upgrade
  your visual cortex a bit, Vision 2.2. And so on, and so on.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">Of course, these are
  exciting, good things. But there’s a downside. Computer hardware isn’t
  going to be the only thing that’s entering your brain. Along with it, the
  Web enters your mind.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="4" color="#FFFF00">Two:
  We are being assimilated</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">In small, high-tech countries like Singapore and
  The Netherlands, the Internet is everywhere you go and everywhere you look
  already. Gaming, shopping, dating, e-mailing, working, reading about the end
  of the world -- it’s all done over the Internet.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">And the Web is still
  on the rise. Not only is it on ever more home computers. As we speak, it is
  entering our TV-sets. It is conquering our laptops and our cell phones.
  It is sneaking into our car computers and household machinery. In fact, the
  Internet is about to incorporate every device we associate with
  ‘communication’.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3"><font color="#FF9900">It
  is only likely the last ‘device’ will be us.</font> Of course, the
  computers implanted in our brains will be connected to the Internet. The
  advantages are just too big not to let this happen. We will have Internet in
  our ears, and Internet on our eyes -- literally. Our brains will be
  permanently online.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">So, you think of ‘aupraishtaka’,
  and instantly know that it is just another word for... Ehm, yes, that. You think of your auntie in
  Timbuktu, and your auntie
  thinks back at you, setting up a telepathic chat session, brain-to-brain. You think of captain Jean-Luc Picard, and his photograph
  will instantly pop up in your mind's eye. It is sent straight into your visual
  cortex, where it is translated into ‘image’ by your brain. You can hear
  Jean-Luc's voice saying ‘Make it so’, if you like, or think up information
  about the actor playing Jean-Luc, and what movies he’s in. Convenient!</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">That's pretty
  difficult to imagine, don't you think? Well -- it gets a bit weirder. With your brain online, ‘you’ will no longer be exclusively
  ‘yours’. You will, in a way, become a local cache for the Internet. Your
  brain will become the Internet’s work memory. And that’s where things
  turn, well... pretty nasty.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" color="#FFFF00" size="4">Three:
  We are being Borged</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">So, here you are.
  You’ve got a computer plugged into your brain. Your mind is online all of the
  time. You’re one smart cyborg, that’s what you are!</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">But what is online,
  is vulnerable. Someone could actually hack your head. Some evil genius could
  virus your mind, or spyware your thoughts. We can agree on one thing: that
  would be, well, more than a bit confusing.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3"><font color="#FF9900">Probably
  the biggest danger are viruses that build themselves.</font> Already, there
  are many experiments with software that becomes smarter -- software that
  evolves, by constantly improving itself. With every inhabitant of the planet
  online, such a virus will have at its disposal plenty of calculating power.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">It is speculative,
  but perhaps you could call a virus like this ‘alive’. Perhaps you could
  say it has a will of its own. You might even call it The Borg.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">So, just picture it:
  one moment, you’re doing fine -- and then, suddenly, you loose control. In
  the mild case, you’ll start having weird, uncontrollable hallucinations.
  You’ll hear some internal voice telling you that resistance is futile, or
  you will experience some reality that isn’t there. You will go insane. In the more extreme case,
  you’ll suddenly find your body is no longer under your control. Somebody --
  or something -- is controlling you, like a puppet. You will have become a
  prisoner, locked up in your own body.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3"><font color="#FF9900"><img border="0" src="borgkubus.jpg" width="279" height="211" align="right" hspace="2" vspace="5">The
  Borg might order you to do all kinds of things.</font> For starters: to
  eliminate everyone who isn’t assimilated yet. Against your will, the Borg
  will force you to hunt down everybody who hasn’t got an internal brain
  computer. You will be forced to operate on them and turn them into cyborgs,
  too. So there you are: suddenly, you find yourself operating on somebody’s
  brain -- without neither your nor the patient’s consent.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">Perhaps the Borg will
  even order you to build a cube-shaped space ship and go out, in search of more
  life-forms to assimilate. To the Borg, more slaves means: more calculating
  power.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" color="#FFFF00" size="4">So:
  to Borg or not to Borg?</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">Perhaps you shrug
  your shoulders. Really, how bad can it be? People being assimilated by the
  Internet...&nbsp; C’mon, that’s just too much.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3"><font color="#FF9900">Then
  again -- maybe it isn’t. </font>Remember the Internet as a mass medium is only
  some 10,
  15 years old. That’s less than 0,001 percent of the time our species is
  around on this planet! Already, computers and the Internet have totally re-shaped
  our world. And we can be sure of one thing: it won't stop there.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">Of course, the Internet, as it is now,
  has little to do with Borgs and cube-shaped space ships. It is as dead as a doornail.
  It doesn't 'want' anything. The Web is still just a bunch of bits and bytes, sitting
  passively on hard disks around the world.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">But the self-learning
  software we mentioned before could change all that. Say, we’ll make
  a self-learning piece of software that has one assignment: &quot;Find a cure
  for cancer&quot;. Actually, software like this already exists: it is software
  that automatically checks certain molecules to see if their shape is suitable
  for curing cancer.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">Ok, now suppose this
  software gets smarter. It could find new, creative ways to do its task.
  Like: &quot;Hey, let’s enslave all these silly little humans. Let’s force
  them to build a giant cube and go out in space to look for a cure for cancer!&quot;
  Aw, that would be so dumb...</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3"><font color="#FF9900">Still,
  there’s
  one small straw of hope to cling on to</font>. Nobody can foresee the future. The Borg Problem seems realistic. But so do other scenarios. Perhaps
  we will be able to erect some kind of advanced firewall between our computers
  and the thing we call our mind. Or perhaps we will be able to see the Borg
  coming, and manage to stop it in time.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">And if we don’t...
  Well, there’s always this. Perhaps going out in a cube and monotonely saying
  &quot;resistance is futile&quot; to everyone we meet will turn out a funny thing
  to do after all. We will see all the corners of the Galaxy, scare the shit out of
  everybody we encounter, know what ‘aupraishtaka’ means and find a cure for
  cancer.<br>
  <br>
  Really, being the Borg isn't all bad.<br>
