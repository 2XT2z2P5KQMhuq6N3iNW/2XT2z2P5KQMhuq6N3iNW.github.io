  only weapon is his sword of holy vengeance.</font></p>

  </div><font face="MS Sans Serif">There he is. Riding a pale white
  horse he suddenly makes his appearance on the beach, blandly rising out of the
  sea. The horseman looks quite kind, really. Well, after all he's only here to
  restore good on Earth.</font>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="MS Sans Serif">But to restore good, evil has got
  to pay. Suddenly, the man on the horse draws a sword. And off he goes, `fast
  like a comet'. Zoom!</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><img border="0" src="kalki1.jpg" width="119" height="131" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="7"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Everywhere
  he rides, he brings about death and destruction. Did you `dress like a king'?
  Chop, there goes your head. Did you `commit sin in mind, speech and actions'?
  Slash, you're dead. Did you lie, did you eat the meat of a cow, were you a
  member of a sect? Stab, you're history.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="MS Sans Serif">It's a little while later, and the
  swordsman takes a break and looks back on a hard day's work. The earth is
  soaked in blood. Billions have died. Only a few truly good men have survived
  the ordeal.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">But the guy
  on the white horse isn't done yet.</font> He takes out some kind of
  supernatural lighter, and sets the place on fire. Crops burn, cities smolder.
  Within moments, the entire planet is on fire. And it goes well beyond that.
  The planets, the stars, yes, the entire Universe burns up.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Well, the man who brings it about
  isn't an average guy. An avenger from heaven he is; the tenth and final
  incarnation of Vishnu, Hindu god for all matters concerning creation and
  destruction. Kalki, is the incarnation's name. And he has come by to make the
  Universe a better place.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="MS Sans Serif">So he does. Once our reality is
  burnt to shingles, Kalki simply creates a new one. The Universe is reborn, the
  stars are reborn, and yes, the Earth is reborn too. A new, purified mankind
  reincarnates on the New Earth. People will be awakened, and `pellucid as
  crystal'. Kalki has led the cosmos into a new, everlasting state of being: the
  Age of Purity.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">Now don't say
  you didn't see it coming.</font> The signs that something was about to happen
  were jotted down many centuries ago in ancient Hindu writings, the <b>Puranas</b>.
  According to the Puranas, we currently live in the <b>Age of Kali</b>: a dark,
  evil cycle of time in which humanity and religion are corrupted and degraded.
  And Kalki is here to put an end to these evil days.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="MS Sans Serif">The omens outlined in the Puranas
  indeed look familiar. In the Kali Age, the Puranas say, world leaders will be
  liars, people will be full of anger and without religion, simple men will be
  rulers, and men will live according to the customs of others. There will be
  many sects and many `experts' claiming to know everything. The planet will be
  valued only as a resource for minerals. Money and expensive clothes will be
  all-important. People will marry solely for pleasure. The world will be
  governed by `powerful men with severe faults' who oppress the poor and support
  the wealthy.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="MS Sans Serif">As the coming of Kalki draws near,
  there will be even more of this. Also, there will be numerous famines,
  droughts, diseases, wars and other calamities. `People become poorer in vigor
  and luster. They are wicked, full of anger, sinful, false and avaricious,' the
  Puranas foresee.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">So it's about
  time Kalki and his swift sword went on judgment tour, right?</font> Oh, come
  on. Get serious. You don't REALLY believe we are about to be chopped up by
  this Kalki guy, do you?</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="MS Sans Serif">For example: another apocalyptic
  `omen' outlined in the Puranas states that men living at the end of the Kali
  Age don't get older than 23 and that the poor will dress in clothes made out
  of tree bark and leaves. And this is definitely not happening -- or at least,
  not yet.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="MS Sans Serif" color="#FFFF00" size="4">Kalki, the
  guy who likes the elite</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Like all apocalyptic writings in
  religion, the Kalki episode of Hinduism is there for a very down to earth,
  social-historic reason. Actually, it has to do with power. The Kalki myth is
  seen as a means to maintain the Hindu caste system, and the rule of the
  supreme Brahmin caste in particular. That's why the Puranas state over and
  over again that in the `evil age' of Kali many ordinary people become rulers
  -- and how wicked that is.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="MS Sans Serif">The Hindu apocalyptic clearly is a
  pro-Brahmin chunk of religion: Kalki, himself a Brahmin, will slash every
  non-Brahmin who dared to become a ruler with top priority. As one scholar
  summarized the story: `Kalki is about to come to cleanse the world of those
  who are not the slaves of Brahmins.'</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">So think of
  Kalki as, well, the Boogie Man of Hinduism.</font> If you disobey the rules of
  the Hindu social order, chop-chop -- you're dead.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Still, the Kalki scenario has
  deeply influenced a lot of faithful believers. The Baha'i faith for example
  claims its founding father Baha'u'llah is actually Kalki -- although
  Baha'u'llah clearly never went on Vengeance Tour and certainly didn't set the
  Universe on fire.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Likewise, the Sai Baba movement
  holds Sai Baba for Kalki. The `Foundation for World Awakening' claims Kalki is
  alive and kicking somewhere in South India. The Bagwan Movement has found its
  Kalki in their leader Vijayakumar. And still others believe the preacher Sri
  Padmavathi Devi in fact is Kalki. No doubt the real Kalki would know how to
  take care of such semi-saviors and their followers.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="MS Sans Serif">In recent days, there have been at
  least three big `Kalki scares' among Hindus. In 1962, the alignment of the
  eight visible planets of the solar system was taken for a heavenly token,
  marking the coming of Kalki. Well, it wasn't.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">In 1984,
  Hindus held their breath again</font>, because the Puranas seemed to suggest
  1984 was Kalki time. And in 2000, Christian millennium fears spread to India,
  as many devoted Hindus prayed for Kalki to please pass their doors. And so he
  did, he didn't show up.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="MS Sans Serif">What `Kalki day' will be up next?
  No one knows. As good predictions do, the Puranas are exceedingly vague about
  the date Kalki is due to arrive. It will happen `when corruption is beyond
  every measure of control, necessitating the end of the world.' So that could
  be any time, really. Better keep your suit of armor on for a while.</font></p>
