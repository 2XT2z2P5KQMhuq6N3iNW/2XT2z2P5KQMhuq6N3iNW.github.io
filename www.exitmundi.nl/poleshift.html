  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">
  They say it gives you cancer. That it makes the use of electricity impossible,
  throwing us back into the Middle Ages. It should turn the atmosphere into a
  deadly brew of toxic gases. That’s how it goes, when suddenly, the Earth’s
  magnetic field stops -- and flips over.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">In case you didn’t
  know -- the Earth is in fact a giant magnet. Around it, there’s this huge
  magnetic field, invisible to the eye. It's a force field, really. It protects us against dangerous, incoming radiation from the sun and
  from deep space. If you’re an incoming space particle, the field will drag you away, and drop you somewhere on the south pole or the
  north pole. You can see this as it is happening: the rain of space particles
  is what we call the Aurora Borealis, the northern light.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3"><font color="#FF9900">But
  every now and then, the magnetic field fades, and flips over.</font> North
  becomes south, and south becomes north. Such magnetic flip-overs are probably
  just as common as Ice Ages. On average, they occur once every 250,000. But the
  last time it happened, it was 780,000 years ago -- so you could say it’s
  time for the planet to flip again.</font></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">And hold your horses,
  our world might be doing just that. For at least three centuries, the Earth’s magnetic field
  has been fading, in an ever faster pace. Right now, it is about 10 percent weaker
  than it was when scientists started keeping track of it in 1845. Also,
  there’s the poetically named ‘South Atlantic Anomaly’. That’s a huge
  chunk of Earth, deep underneath the
  ocean floor, where the turnover has already begun.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">Gladly, the pole
  shift doesn’t
  mean the world is about to ‘fall over’ or something, as many people fear.
  The ice caps won’t suddenly move to Africa. During flip-over,
  only the <b> magnetic</b> poles change position. You will have to change the name
  ‘north pole’ into ‘south pole’ and get used to the fact that compass
  needles point southwards from now on. That’s basically it.</font></p>

  </div>But
  you wouldn’t be reading this </font>on a site about the end of the world, if
  there wasn’t some problem, too. When north and south swap, our magnetic space
  shield will be down for a while. In fact, computer simulations suggest an even
  more bizarre scenario. For thousands of years, there will be multiple
  magnetic poles, aimlessly wandering about. There will be a few magnetic north
  poles lumbering through your backyard, while another magnetic pole -- say, a
  south pole -- will pass in front of your house.</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">This will have all
  kind of bizarre effects. Birds and other migrating animals will lose their
  way. Ships, airplanes and travelers relying on
  compasses will get lost, too.<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#FF9900">Meanwhile, the night sky is filled with ghostly
  streaks of colored light</font> -- that Aurora Borealis again, but this time in
  your backyard. There will be power cuts, as the Earth is hit
  by solar radiation. Watching TV, listening to the radio or talking over the
  telephone will become difficult, and sometimes impossible. Communication lines will
  be downed; satellites will be zapped. There could even be spontaneous
  outbreaks of fires -- this is what happened during an extreme solar radiation
  storm in 1859. And back then, the magnetic field was on!</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">Meanwhile, your
  body is zapped, too. The invisibly small space particles shoot through your
  body, ripping through your DNA. This can give you cancer, or horribly mutated offspring. For several thousands of years, it will
  be like living next to
  the crashed nuclear plant of Chernobyl. Well, with the exception that in
  Chernobyl, you could at least use the telephone!</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">So gradually,
  humanity will be reduced to a monstrous, sick, cancerous and demented bunch,
  right? Well --
  perhaps not.<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#FF9900">Indeed, all unpleasant effects outlined above are real. </font>But
  science agrees that they won’t be that severe. The magnetic flip won’t wipe
  out our civilization, as many doom sayers suggest. Fact is, we can do
  without our magnetic blanket for a while.</font></p>

  </div>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">Take a look at the
  cancers. It is estimated that without magnetic field, we would have 15 extra
  cases of cancer in every 1 million people a year. That is of course awful --
  but hardly catastrophic. Each year, more people die of the common
  flu!</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">Without magnetic
  field, Earth is still protected by its thick atmosphere. If you’re that evil
  particle from outer space again, you will have to zig zag your way through a thick soup
  of oxygen, nitrogen and other gases first, before you can finally shoot a
  human being. Chances are that long before, you will have bumped into an
  atmospheric gas molecule.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3"><font color="#FF9900">In
  fact, there are two places where the magnetic field is almost zero already</font>:
  the north and the south pole. There, the field dumps the space particles it
  has caught -- right on the heads of the Inuit (Eskimos) and polar
  explorers. But despite all that, the Inuit and the explorers are doing fine. Even
  their electricity works.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">And if that doesn’t
  calm you down, consider this. You and I won’t live to witness the next
  swap. It should take at least a few more centuries, before the poles come
  marching in.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">That being said --
  one nightmarish fact remains. In the long run, the magnetic field could indeed
  kill us all. In a few billions of years, chances are the field shuts down for
  good because the Earth’s core freezes... But that’s <a href="core.html"> another
  story</a>!</font></p>
