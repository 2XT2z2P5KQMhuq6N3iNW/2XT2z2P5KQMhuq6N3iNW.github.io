  </div>It’s some decades later. Things on Earth
  have gotten out of hand -- totally. Our planet has turned into a cold,
  terrible place. Outside, a dark gray ceiling of clouds permanently covers the
  sky. The Sun hasn’t shone for many, many years. It’s twilight out there,
  always. And it’s cold: a devastating ice age has come upon the planet.</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Trust us: you <b>don't</b>
  want to live here. In the eternal night outside, people die by the millions.
  Those who survive, have turned into pale, sickly, depressed, lost souls who
  could do with a sunny vacation. In isolated bands, they stumble about through
  the darkness, cuddled together, clinging to life as good as they can. The
  stuff we call ‘culture’ has all but slipped away from them; the world's
  economy has long collapsed. Today, men live much like our ape-like ancestors
  did, always hungry, and always looking for food. They feed on a disgusting
  diet of slimy funguses, insects, rodents and mosses -- the only edible things
  that survive.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">And
  frankly, without sunlight, mankind doesn’t stand a chance.</font> Oxygen
  levels will drop, and food will get ever scarcer. In the end, we’ll die a
  horrible death, one man after the other, one community after the next.
  Probably, we will have forgotten what kind of a lush, sunny planet Earth once
  was.</font></p>

      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Still, out there, above the
  clouds, the Sun is shining as bright as ever. It’s the thick clouds, that
  are causing all the trouble. They bounce back the sunlight into space,
  preventing it from reaching the Earth’s surface and its inhabitants. The
  result: darkness, and cold.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">So, who
  put those clouds up there in the first place?</font> Well, blame yourself: you
  did. You guessed it: it’s those humans and their pollution again. The Dark
  Apocalypse even has an official name: ‘global dimming’.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Already, the Earth is a bit
  darker and shadowyer than it should have been. Global Dimming was first
  discovered in the 1980s. In Israel, agricultural biologist Gerald Stanhill
  coincidentally discovered something weird: the sun shines about 22 percent
  less in Israel than it did in the 1950s. It is as if someone is slowly turning
  off the lights!</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Then came 9-11. In the days
  following the terrorist attacks, air traffic was grounded. This led to a
  sudden, remarkable change in American weather. For three days, it was
  unusually sunny in the US. The nights were exceptionally bright. On average,
  it got one degree Celsius warmer in the US during those days. That doesn’t
  sound like much -- but it’s huge, in terms of climatology: the biggest jump
  in temperature ever witnessed.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">After
  that, more evidence poured in that the world is really getting darker.</font> Scientists discovered that water
  evaporates less readily than it did before. And the evidence came from all over the
  planet: the US is 10 percent darker now than it was
  in the 1950s, Western Europe 16 percent, and Russia almost 30 percent.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif">In fact, global dimming may
  have made its first victims already. In the 1980s, about a million Africans in
  the Sahel died during a massive drought. According to one theory, it was
  global dimming’s doing: the Sun simply didn’t shine hard enough to
  ‘power up’ the system that should have given the Sahel its rainy season.
  Poor Africans.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="4" color="#FFFF00">Freeze
  or fry?</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif">But hey, wait a minute,
  wasn’t the world getting warmer, instead of colder? How about global
  warming? You’re absolutely right. There’s massive evidence that the world
  is indeed getting warmer. But it’s also getting darker. In fact,
  many scientists believe that global dimming puts the brakes on the warming of
  our planet. Without global dimming, global warming would be much, much worse!</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif">And there’s no telling which
  will win in the end, heat or cold. Roughly speaking, global dimming is
  faster and heftier, while global warming is slower and more gradual. Somewhere
  down the line, there could be a threshold, a point where Dimming beats
  Warming. Suddenly, we’d see temperatures drop. We’d be preparing that
  rodent soup in the dark in no time -- say, within several generations.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">On the
  other hand, maybe we will be fine.</font> There’s an upshot: the particles
  in the sky that bounce back the sunlight, don’t live that long. They’ll
  rain down on Earth and get washed away, and that will be it. No ice age, no
  chewing on rats and bugs. (Well, unless the so-called ‘Hydroxyl Collapse’
  kicks in -- but that’s <a href="hydroxyl.html">another story</a>.)</font><font face="MS Sans Serif"><o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif">What’s more, we’re killing
  global dimming already. In Europe and the US, more and more laws forbid the
  use of fuels and chemicals that puff noxious particles in the air. Off with
  you, you mean, sunlight-blocking clouds of dirt!</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif">But hold it. There could be a
  horrible backlash. Didn’t we just say that global dimming very likely holds
  back global warming? There you go: if we stop polluting the skies and put that
  sunlight back on, the consequences could be truly apocalyptic. Global warming
  will fiercely kick in again. Suddenly, the Sun will shine abundantly, pushing
  temperatures up by several degrees. We’d have savage summers, and lukewarm
  winters.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">According
  to several studies, this would sort of... well, kill us, really.</font> By
  2030, the poles, the glaciers and Greenland’s ice sheet would melt. <a href="sealevel.html">Sea
  levels would jump up</a>, flooding billions of homes. The Amazon rainforest
  would whither and turn into desert. The northern parts of Europe and the US
  would get an African climate. We might even have a <a href="Runaway_greenhouse.html">runaway
  greenhouse effect</a>, a spine-chilling climate mishap that would literally
  kill every living on Earth.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif">So, what do you prefer? To fry
  or to freeze? Would you like to get roasted, or would you rather die in the
  dark, chewing on bugs? Hmm... Perhaps it’s a better idea to cut down a
  little on both pollution and greenhouse gases, after all.</font></p>
