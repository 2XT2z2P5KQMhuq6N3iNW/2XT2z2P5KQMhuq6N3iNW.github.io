  Chances are you haven’t noticed it, but there’s a war between the sexes
  going on. A foul, chemical war it is, a bitter battle to the death. Gladly,
  it’s a rather small-scale war. The parties doing the fighting are sex
  chromosomes: tiny, curled-up molecules of DNA, that lay hidden within each
  human cell.<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#FF9900">
  Still, the future of mankind is what’s at stake.</font> You see, it’s a war
  between boys and girls -- literally. And here’s the latest news from the
  battlefield: the women are winning. At least, that's what it looks like. The girls are about to wipe the boys from
  the face of the earth.
  </font></span>
    <table border="0" width="219" align="right">

          <b>X vs. Y:</b>  The Y-chromosome already looks tiny and weak compared
          to the X-chromosome.</font></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font face="MS Sans Serif">As
  you may know, there are two kinds of sex chromosomes: X and Y. If you
  inherited<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>two X’s at conception
  (one X from every parent), you’re a woman. When your father gave you a
  Y-chromosome, it adds up to XY -- which stands for man. All in all, the
  Y-chromosome is the thing that makes a man a man. Well, apart from that other
  thingy, that is.<br>
  <br>
  On Y, you’ll find all the stuff that a man
  needs. You’ll find genetic instructions for how to brew semen,
  and how to grow a trunk -- no, a little lower, if you please. If there exists
  a gene for watching football and telling lame sex jokes, you’ll definitely
  find it on the Y-chromosome.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">But
  on Y, you’ll also find stuff that is harmful to women.</font> For example: sperm
  contains chemicals that attack the woman’s body. Really! Semen comes with
  chemicals that shut down the woman’s immune system, so that it can make it
  into the womb alive.
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">That's
  why X, the female chromosome, hates Y.</font> In response, X is constantly throwing all kinds of wicked
  chemicals at Y. X is killing Y.<br style="mso-special-character:line-break">
  <br>
  Take a look through the microscope, and you can immediately see Y is in
  trouble. Y is a tiny, crumpled
  chromosome -- not exactly a proud symbol of manliness. Ever since Y split off
  from the other chromosomes, some 300 million years ago, its number of genes
  went down from about 1,000 to 80. How did it ever get so
  tiny? You guessed it: that's because of the female chromosome's attacks.<br>
  <br>
  But even without a microscope, the signs are clear. The fact that
  some people are gay or transsexual could be a direct consequence of the battle
  between the X- and the Y-chromosome, some geneticists think.</font></span></p>

      </tr>
    </table>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">And
  there are more grizzly clues.</font> For example,
  every now and then, doctors coincidentally stumble upon a woman who has XY for
  chromosomes -- the ‘male’ combination. Somehow these ladies'
  X-chromosomes&nbsp; have found a
  way to disable the Y-chromosome.<br>
  <br>
  And in 1947, a French hospital admitted a female patient who gave birth to a
  baby girl. The woman wasn’t the least surprised. <b>All </b>births in her
  family were females, she told the doctors. Scientific investigation confirmed
  this. Somehow, the family’s genes had found a way to overcome the
  ‘man-problem’. Her family had learned how to kill Y. And now, the family's
  women no longer gave birth to any boys.<br>
  <br>
  Perhaps the most spine-chilling clue comes from the men. As we speak, 1 to 2
  percent of all men is infertile because of a malfunctioning Y-chromosome! That
  doesn't seem like much, but it is an astonishing number, because the defects
  cannot have been inherited (because they lead to infertility). So in other
  words: 1 to 2 percent of all men have their Y-chromosome disabled during their
  life!&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#FF9900">You don’t have to be a rocket scientist to see where
  that could lead.</font> A couple of thousands of years more, and Y could be
  history. Suddenly, you would see the number of men dropping sharply. According
  to an estimate of the British geneticist Brian Sykes, it could take only 5,000
  generations before the world turned into a place almost exclusively inhabited
  by women.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font face="MS Sans Serif">No,
  you dirty little sod, that’s NOT a man’s paradise. Indeed; with the
  numbers of men falling, probably everyone around will be craving for your
  semen. But it will most likely not be quite like you picture it. Instead of
  endless erotic nights, think of handing your goody over to the nearest
  fertility clinic, where the female doctors will try to impregnate as many
  women as possible with your increasingly rare sperm cells.<br>

  Sex would be an intolerable waste of sperm cells. And besides, you can’t
  afford risking a heart attack while practicing the world oldest sport. Your
  semen has become the most valuable fluid on earth now! The women might even
  decide to keep the last men captive, like a priceless piece of kettle.<br>
  <br>
  And
  how’s this for your world-without-men. There will be no one to watch the
  games with. No one to talk about cars with. In fact, there will be no football
  anymore and no fight movies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You
  will be heavily discriminated against by all these giggling, chit-chatting
  GIRLS you’ll see everywhere. It will be a lonely existence. If you’re a
  guy, that is.<br>
  <br>
  And the obvious downside: in the end, everyone will be dead. Without men, no
  babies. Without babies, no mankind. So we’d clone ourselves, you say? Well
  -- not too many people know of it, but the latest scientific insight is that
  this is very, very problematic. Clones are full of genetic errors, causing
  them to die early. And it’s still undecided if that’s a problem that can
  ever be solved.<o:p>

  defense mechanism against X. The Y-chromosome has made a secret back-up of itself
  in reverse. It has its key genes tattooed backwards on its own body, so to
  say. Shoot a hole in Y, and it simply repairs itself by copy-pasting the
  back-up onto the wound. It seems that the Y-chromosome is less vulnerable than
  most people think.</span></font><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><br>

    </table>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif">On the other hand: the sex
  chromosome mishap isn't unique. We know of at least <span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">three animals where the
  women are winning. Take the eggfly butterfly (Hypolimnas bolina) of Australia.
  In the 1970s biologists discovered that most of the butterfly’s offspring is
  female -- almost half of all males mysteriously die before birth. Exactly the
  same sinister effect was found for the two-spot ladybird (Adalia bipunctata).<o:p></o:p>
  </span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#FF9900">Even
  more eery is the case</font> of another insect, the buterfly Acrea encedon. As
  we speak, there’s only 3 percent boy butterflies left, with the ladies
  taking on 97 percent of the population -- and rising!<br>
  <br>
  On the other hand, there's the case of a small rodent from Turkey called the
  mole vole (Ellobius lutescens). Millions of years ago, the X-chromosomes in
  this animal succeeded in eliminating the Y-chromosome. But the rodent did
  something remarkable. It evacuated all male genes to other genes. This quirk
  of nature still astounds biologists. But it also indicates that men in theory
  should be able to overcome the attack of the girls.</span></font></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">So
  in the end, what will happen? Nobody knows, the jury is still out. On the one
  hand, some geneticists point out that X is in the majority. </span></font><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font face="MS Sans Serif"> Since
  women have two X’s and men one X and one Y, X outnumbers the Y-chromosomes
  by three to one.<br>
  <br>
  But on the other hand, some researchers suspect foul play. Perhaps the
  doomsayers are only making fun of Y's small size. While having a smaller one
  doesn't necessarily mean that it won't function. (Yes, yes, I know...)<br>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">Still,
  like most of the scenarios outlined on Exit
  Mundi, the one with the chromosomes already happened once - almost.</font> Somewhere in our
  prehistoric past, X seems to have launched a massive attack on Y. It must have
  been a very close call. But Y succeeded in repairing itself at last. We
  can tell this has happened because of certain scars that are still detectable on the
  male chromosome.<br>
  </font><font face="MS Sans Serif"><br>
  Is that comforting, proof that Y can deal with the attacks of the girls? Or
  has it weakened Y, and should we worry all the more about the next attack?
  Better keep an eye on those birth statistics, guys...<br>
