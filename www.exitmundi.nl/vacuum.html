  </div><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 12.0pt; mso-hyphenate: none" align="left"><font face="MS Sans Serif">It
  was all supposed to be under control. Sure, in the 1990s, there were some
  oddball scientists who gave off warnings that things might one day go terribly
  wrong at the lab. But no-one really cared.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 12.0pt; mso-hyphenate: none" align="left"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Unfortunately, the oddballs were right. Today, during an experiment in
  high-energy physics, the inconceivable happened. The experiment triggered what
  scientists call a <b>quantum vacuum collapse</b>. And one second later, the
  dreaded phenomenon has wiped out all matter on the planet. The world with
  everything and everyone on it has simply ceased to exist.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 12.0pt; mso-hyphenate: none" align="left"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">But
  that's not all.</font> Traveling at the speed of light, a huge wave of
  destruction sets out from where the Earth used to be. Like the shockwave of a
  bomb exploding,
  it flings off into all directions. And everywhere it passes, it brings about
  mayhem and destruction. Voom! -- there goes the Moon. Slam! -- that was the
  Sun. Spat! -- Mars, Jupiter, Pluto; all gone. The shockwave never stops. It
  will expand and expand. And expand, until every molecule in the Universe is
  dead.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 12.0pt; mso-hyphenate: none" align="left"><font face="MS Sans Serif">So,
  what exactly is going on? The answer takes you to the heart of <b>quantum
  physics</b>: the chunk of science that deals with the tiny particles that make
  up everything in the Universe. Quantum theory predicts that the Universe is
  filled with so-called <b>vacuum energy</b> -- which is the average energy of
  all those zillions of particles that pop into and out of existence everywhere
  around us each moment. As the Universe expanded, the vacuum energy dropped
  down to the lowest possible level. Well, in theory, that is.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 12.0pt; mso-hyphenate: none" align="left"><font face="MS Sans Serif">There
  is, however, a small possibility that the theory is wrong. The Universe may be
  still `hung up' in an unstable energetic state. If so, a fierce jolt of energy
  in just the right place may be exactly what it takes to tip the balance.</font> <span lang="EN-US" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif">It
  would be like putting a needle into a balloon. Within a fraction of a second, a
  HUGE blast of energy will set free, as the quantum vacuum plunges into a lower
  energetic state.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 12.0pt; mso-hyphenate: none" align="left"><span lang="EN-US" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">The
  destructive energy that is unleashed</font> will be quite different from
  everything we know. Literally every atom in our part of the cosmos will spew
  out energy. You can't even BEGIN to imagine the bizarre consequences this
  would have. For one thing, ordinary matter will become unstable and cease to
  exist.<img border="0" src="vacuum2.jpg" align="right" width="167" height="124"></font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 12.0pt; mso-hyphenate: none" align="left"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><span style="letter-spacing: -.15pt">So
  what would spark off the collapse? Well: particle accelerators, for example.
  In a particle accelerator, science smashes all kinds of tiny particles into
  each other to learn more about matter&nbsp; and the Universe. Now that's neat --
  but according to critics, there's a real possibility such collisions may yield
  enough energy to push the Universe off balance. `The Universe can be blown to
  smithereens', as one of them (Paul Dixon) cosily put it in 1998.</span></font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 12.0pt; mso-hyphenate: none" align="left"><span lang="EN-US" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">If
  you find all this hard to understand, don't worry. </font> Even specialized physicists
  don't fully understand how the quantum vacuum works. So their line of
  reasoning is simple: everywhere in the Universe, all kinds of atoms, molecules and particles slam into each other
  constantly. So if the
  quantum vacuum&nbsp; indeed were unstable, it would have had plenty of opportunity to
  collapse already. Simply put: the Universe cannot be a barrel of gunpowder,
  since nature constantly throws all kinds of burning fuses into it.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 12.0pt; mso-hyphenate: none" align="left"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Phew,
  that indeed seems reassuring. On the other hand: as some physicists have pointed
  out, there is also a possibility nature simply hasn't found the right fuse yet. And
  here on Earth, we're experimenting with all kinds of new fuses -- for example,
  we're doing and planning particle accelerator experiments with rare elements
  such as gold and with elements that are so unstable they don't exist in `real'
  nature.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 12.0pt; mso-hyphenate: none" align="left"><span lang="EN-US" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">What's
  more, accidents happen.</font> And the bigger the science, the bigger the
  accidents. So please, dear physicists. If you read this, please be a little
  careful.</font></span></p>
