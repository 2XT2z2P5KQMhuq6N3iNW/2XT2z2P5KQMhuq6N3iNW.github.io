    In fact, we're still living in an Ice Age today. The ice caps that cover the
    poles and the mountain tops are the best proof of that. Our Ice Age,
    dubbed the <b>pleistocene epoch</b>, began some 1,6 million years ago. And
    it still lasts.<o:p></o:p>

    if we're living in Ice Age now, Ice Ages can't be that bad, you say. Oh,
    but that's only because currently, we live in an Ice Age phase that
    geologists call an <b>interglacial</b>: a period of milder temperatures
    inbetween ice-cold, frost-dominated <b>glacials</b>. During interglacial,
    the ice recedes to the mountain tops and the polar caps. It just sits there
    and waits.<o:p>

    don't mistake: the threat is there all the same. In Ice Ages such as
    the one we live in, &quot;glacials&quot; is the rule; &quot;no glacials&quot; the exception. While
    interglacials last only 10,000 to 15,000 years,
    a typical glacial roughly lasts 100,000 years. Frost and bizarre cold is in
    fact currently the default climate of the northern hemisphere!<o:p></o:p>

          water from the tropics to Europe and the US. This acts as a heating
          system, and keeps the continents about 10 degrees Celsius warmer than
          they should be. But many scientists think that every now and then, the
          Gulf Stream breaks down. This could trigger a 'mini Ice Age' in the
          West -- just like the one that lasted from 1300 AD to 1850 AD. And
          don't look now: the current has decreased by 20 percent since the
          1950s.</font></td>

          the Earth would cool dramatically. Perhaps this is what happened when
          the first green plants appeared: they sucked all carbon dioxide out of
          the atmosphere, and maybe triggered an Ice Age. Perhaps it will happen
          again, when we suddenly start using 'clean' fuels. The amount of CO2
          in the atmosphere would plummet. This would rob our planet of its warm
          little blanket.</font></td>

          affects Ice Ages. Continents on the poles should be bad news. A huge
