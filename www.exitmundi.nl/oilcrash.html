They call it ‘Economic

  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif">It isn’t hard to explain
  what the trouble is all about. The 'Oil Peak' is the point where the world’s
  oil supplies are exactly half used up. Yes, I felt some relief when I heard
  that for the first time, too. Apparently, after all these decades of
  industries and cars, we’ve still got half of all our oil supplies left! Put
  precisely: we started out with an estimated total of about 2 trillion barrels.
  And in 2003, some 900 billion of it had been used.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">But
  there's a downside.</font> When an oil well is half empty, you’ll have to go
  through an increasing amount of trouble to pump the last bit up. Think of it
  like eating yogurt out of a carton. At first, you’ll have no trouble to
  bring out spoonfuls of yogurt at all. But after a while, you’ll carefully
  have to maneuver your spoon around along the sides and corners of the carton
  to bring the last bit out. In oil wells, it goes the same way.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif">So when half of all oil in the
  world is up, the price per barrel will begin to rise. The prices will steadily
  go up, with about 1,5 to 3 percent a year. But meanwhile, world demand for oil
  is on the rise, too. Currently, the entire world consumes about 75 million
  barrels a day -- or 25 <b> billion</b> barrels per year. But in ten years time, demand
  is expected to rise by more than two thirds, to 135 million barrels a day.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">Obviously,
  there's a gap here. </font>We’ll have an oil crisis. According to some
  estimates, the price of a barrel of oil will increase, don’t look now, <b>five-</b>
  to <b>six-</b>fold in only a few years time, to prices up to 200 dollars per
  barrel! This will unleash a worldwide economic crisis beyond imagination,
  making the Great Depression of the 1930s look like a fun time.</font></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">The real problem, of course,
  is that our society is addicted to cheap, abundant oil.</font> Our cars, airplanes
  and ships run on oil. Our electricity is generated in oil-fueled power plants.
  The stuff you buy in the stores is brought there by trucks that run on oil. In
  the end, literally everything is to some degree ‘made’ of oil!</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif">So when oil gets expensive, so
  does our world. Even seemingly innocent things like socks, drinking water and
  bread will become very expensive. Factories and businesses will go bankrupt. Unemployment will
  explode, pushing up the
  state deficit and deepening the crisis even more. Banks will shut down,
  thereby killing the savings of their clients. In the end, the Oil Peak will
  send massive shockwaves through the world’s economies.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">If
  you’re an American, your problems are even worse.</font> The US economy is
  particularly vulnerable to oil problems, not just because the US consumes so
  much oil, but also because the oil trade worldwide goes
  in dollars. Consequently, when the oil trade hampers, the US economy takes the
  punches.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif">But you don’t want to live
  in one of the developing countries, either. South-America and Africa are very vulnerable to an oil crisis too, because their economies are
  weak as they are already. The Peak Oil will trigger an instant and sharp

  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">So if
  it’s all that bad, we’d just turn to some other kind of energy, right?</font>
  We’ll have wind mills, and solar cells, and everything will be cool again,
  you say. Well -- actually, that won’t work. The problem is that at the
  moment, there just are no real alternatives!</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Take wind energy. Wind is
  obviously stuff that doesn’t contain a lot of energy -- just compare
  slamming your head into a bit of wind with slamming it into a concrete wall.
  And what’s more: to build wind mills, you’ll have to weld steel, drive all
  kinds of stuff and engineers around in trucks and cars, build factories and
  make thousands of components. In the end, it costs more energy (oil) to
  actually build
  a windmill, than a windmill will ever generate during its entire lifetime!</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Roughly the same goes for other
  so-called ‘alternatives’, like solar cells, hydrogen energy, biomass energy
  and what-have-you (for the details, check the Q&amp;A below). They all cost more energy (oil) than they produce! The
  only realistic alternatives are gas and nuclear power. But gas runs out too, and
  it doesn’t help that we are closing down many of our nuclear power plants.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">Nuclear
  fusion, perhaps?</font> Indeed, that would be a clean, good alternative to
  oil. But the problem here is, the technology just isn’t ready yet. We need
  to do more research. After all, you don’t want to risk blowing up part of
  the planet in an all-too-hastily done fusion experiment. &quot;You wanted
  energy? Here, have some!&quot;<br>
  <br>
  And of course, even when it comes to alternatives, we’ve still got this
  world here that is hooked on oil. Our cars run on gasoline, not on
  electricity. So we need to replace all of our cars and rebuild and rewire most
  of our society first, before we can use nuclear fusion or nuclear power. And
  that takes a lot of, uhm... the black stuff.<br>

  <font color="#FFFF00" size="4" face="MS Sans Serif">The cavalry and we</font></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">But hold
  it now, you say: we’ve faced oil crises before, haven’t we?</font> Indeed,
  in 1973 and 1979, the flow of oil hampered too, plunging the world economy
  into crisis instantaneously. But back then, it was all easy. Venezuela just
  pushed up their oil production a bit -- and presto, cheap oil was back again.
  This time, it is all different. Once we’ve passed the Oil Peak, there will
  be no cavalry to help us out. Every oil producing country faces the same
  problem. We’ll have to go cold turkey on our oil addiction. That's just the
  way it is.</font></p>

  economists think we will reach the Oil Peak sometime over the next few years
  -- before 2010. The leading Association for the Study of Peak Oil (ASPO)
  calculates 2008 will be the year.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif">But in fact, there are some
  disturbing signs the crisis has begun already. Obviously, the oil price is in

  We’ll see death and destruction, and see our world change forever. Can’t
  say we’re looking forward to it, either.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif">And even then, we’d have to
  have some luck. There’s a particularly nasty glitch in the theories even the

        idea.</font><br>
        <br>
        As we explained above, windmills are in fact very
        energy-inefficient. It has
        been estimated that if you wanted to replace all of the UK's energy for
        wind, you'd have to build a vast, kilometers wide park of windmills that
        literally surrounds the island!</font>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">More technically, the problem is that the
        power a wind mill generates is proportionate to the third power of the
        wind speed. That's quite a mouthful, but simply put, it means that when
        the wind speed halves (say, from 6 Beaufort to 3 Beaufort), the power
        goes down not by 1/2, but by 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2. That's an amazing 88 percent less power!
        And you can't simply build a better wind mill. The 'power curve' is a
        physical property of wind. It is just how wind works!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The consequences of this are dramatic. A good, modern wind turbine only
        really generates electricity between wind forces 4 and 7/8. Less wind, and the
        mill will hardly generate any power at all (because of the power curve). Go above it, and the
        power will get so big, the wind
        turbine will have to shut down, to prevent damage.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The bottom line is this. On average, a wind mill only generates
        something like 16 percent of the power it should produce! So when you
        see a wind mill that has a tag &quot;One megaWatt&quot; on it, it only
        does so under ideal circumstances. On average, it only produces 160
        thousand Watt. (Source: Dutch research, in: J.J. Halkema, &quot;Windmolens,

        </font>Hydrogen indeed a cheap, clean source of energy. But there's a catch: you can't&nbsp; find it anywhere
        on Earth.
        You will have to make it first, by splitting
        up water (H2O) into hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2). And that costs you...
        yes, energy.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This makes hydrogen nothing more than a
        modern battery. You invest energy in making it, and after a while, you
        tap energy from it again. But like every battery, it won't magically
        give off more energy than you put into it in the first place.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">And that's not everything. You will have
        to store your hydrogen somewhere. This means you will have to compress
        it into a high-pressure tank. Those tanks are heavy, and the compressing
        costs you... energy.</font></p>

        Orimulsion is another fossil fuel, made of
        bitumen. And indeed, there's an estimated supply of it of about 1,2
        trillion barrels. Even better: you can quite easily
        turn it into petrol, and use it to generate electricity.<br>
        <br>
        But that was the sunny side. In the 1980s and 1990s, several power plants
        tried orimulsion. But they were shut down, because refining and burning
        orimulsion is very, very dirty. Orimulsion contains up to 2,9 percent
        sulphur. This ends up as sulphuric acid in the atmosphere. That gives
        you HUGE problems, like global warming, acid rain, dangerous
        smog and global dimming. No wonder orimulsion has been nicknamed
        &quot;the world's dirtiest fuel&quot;! You really don't want to use it.<br>

      <td width="50%"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#FF9900">True.<br>
        <br>
        </font> Indeed, the estimated supply of coal is 2 trillion
        tons. And yes, you can wrench oil out of coal. In fact, as we speak,
        about 23 percent of all energy of the world comes from coal.<br>
        <br>
        But the down side to this is that coal will run out
        eventually, too. Some say it will last 18 years, others say longer. And
        that's not all. We'd have to adapt many of our factories and power plants
        and refineries, which would require HUGE investments. And then, coal is
        another very dirty fossil fuel. It chokes up the atmosphere even more
        than oil does.<br>

        Most of the world's oil is 'dirty' - it is mixed up with clay, sand and
        other stuff you cannot burn. And indeed, you can purify oil out of it.
        But: out of one truckload full of tar sands, you will get only about
        half a barrel of oil. That's not exactly what we would call 'making a
        profit'. In fact, since trucks and drilling machines run on oil too,
        you'd have to work really hard to actually 'gain' oil. This definitely
        won't bring back the cheap oil.<br>

      <td width="50%"><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF00" size="3">So, we'd go back to good old
        <b> nuclear energy</b>, right?</font></td>
      <td width="50%"><font color="#FF9900" face="Arial" size="2">That will only

        Indeed, nuclear power plants offer a steady, very reliable and
        relatively clean energy
        source. Ok, the downside is that every now and then, nuclear power
        plants tend to go kaboom, like they did in Harrisburg and Chernobyl. And
        then, there's the waste:
        radioactive mud, not to be touched for several hundreds of years. But perhaps, we're going to have to take
        problems like these for granted.<br>
        <br>
        The bigger problem is that nuclear power plants run on very special
        stuff. You will need to collect enough of the rare element Uranium, and
        carefully select the 0,7% of it that is Uranium-235 (the rest is another
        isotope, Uranium-238, which is useless). Or you could use Plutonium-239,
        an even rarer element.<br>
        <br>
        What's more, Uranium and Plutonium will be up in the end.<br>

        '<b>nuclear fusion</b>'?</font></td>
      <td width="50%"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#FF9900">That might help

        <br>
        In 'common' nuclear energy, you split an atom and tap the energy. In nuclear
        fusion, you squeeze atoms together to make new ones, and tap the energy.
        That's
        exactly what happens inside the&nbsp; Sun.<br>
        <br>
        Indeed, fusion energy is
        much cleaner than ordinary nuclear fission energy. But there's a
        downside, too: every now and then, you'd have to replace your entire factory,
        because it has become radioactive. Nuclear fusion turns factories into
        radioactive waste.<br>
