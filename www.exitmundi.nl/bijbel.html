<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="center"><font face="MS Sans Serif" color="#FF9900" size="4">Millions
  have prayed, sacrificed, repented, flogged their backs, pilgrimaged, even
  killed themselves -- all because of the particularly nasty scenario of doom
  and destruction laid down in the Bible book `The Apocalypse'. However, most
  modern Bible experts agree that St. John never meant the end of the world to
  be taken too literally.</font></p>
  <font FACE="Courier New"></font>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Okay, so here's what's gonna
  happen. According to John's visions, it all starts to go wrong when the `lamb
  of God' one day decides to open up the huge, sealed book of life. The looks of
  the lamb betray little good. As John writes, it looks `as it it were slain,
  having seven horns and seven eyes.'</font></p>

  </div><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Don't worry, we mortals probably
  won't have to face this heavenly lamb -- yet. The first thing we do notice, is
  four horsemen: one on a white horse, one red, one black and one pale. The band
  of horsemen is here to bring about a lot of misery. The swordsman on the red
  horse spreads war, the man on the black horse leaves a trail of famine, and
  that skinny guy sitting on the pale horse, that's Death himself, bringing
  `plagues or pestilence' -- John leaves it up to Mr. Death to decide. By the
  way, the guy with the crown and the bow on horse #4 causes no problems
  in particular.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="MS Sans Serif">The horsemen are barely there,
  and here comes more trouble. Suddenly, the Sun goes black. The Moon becomes
  red as blood. There's a massive earthquake. Amazingly, the stars drop from the
  sky like figs from a tree, and the heaven slams shut `as a book folded up'.
  All mountains are dislocated, and every island begins to drift.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><img border="0" src="matthews10_horsemen.jpg" width="155" height="175" align="left"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">Still
  surviving, right?</font> Wait, the worst is yet to come. Suddenly, everything
  becomes quiet, and in the `four corners of the world' (sic), four angels
  appear. It's the angels that cause the silence: they hold back all wind. Then,
  from the direction of the Sun, a fifth angel descends, carrying a special item
  John calls `the seal of God'. The angel marks the slim total of 140.000 Jewish
  people with the seal, and rushes home. By now, you're probably beginning to
  feel somewhat nervous. John anyway foresaw that a huge crowd would dress in
  white robes and pray for salvation.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="MS Sans Serif">And to be honest, nothing has
  really happened yet. After half an hour of complete silence, all hell breaks
  loose. There's a huge thunderstorm, there's the sound of voices coming out of
  nowhere, and there's another massive earthquake. Next, there's hail. And fire,
  burning up all grass and pulverizing one third of all trees. A mountain-sized
  comet plunges into the sea, turning one third of all water into blood while
  killing a third of all organisms living in the sea, and sinking one third of
  all ships.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">It becomes
  darker still.</font> A talking eagle is spotted. It screeches there's more to
  come. And that's no understatement. For the next moment, another meteor
  plummets into the Earth. An
  angel brings out a key and uses it to open the lid of a bottomless pit
  humanity somehow overlooked. Now, you're in for some REAL trouble.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="MS Sans Serif">There's smoke coming from the
  pit, and then, suddenly, huge amounts of killer locusts, each as lethal as a scorpion, flock
  out of the smoke. The scorpion locusts leave the 140.000 who carry the divine
  sign unscathed, but sting everyone else, for five long months in a row. By
  now, people `shall desire to die,' John estimates. But isn't that a pity: to
  their astonishment, they discover it is no longer possible to die.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900"><img border="0" src="matthews3_bible_scorpion.jpg" width="194" height="226" align="right">Then,
  after those five painful months</font>, the locusts take the shape of horses,
  albeit with manlike faces, long hair and lion's fangs. They total the number
  of two hundred million. The king of the monsters, a guy appropriately named `Exterminans',
  arrives at the scene.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Still holding out? Prepare
  yourself, actually they've been treating you mildly so far. Suddenly, the
  locust army out of hell sets out for a huge massacre, butchering one third of
  all people. People are burnt, suffocated in smoke, or squashed by huge lumps
  of brimstone, all of which sling out of the locust's mouths. Cities crumble,
  Jerusalem is destroyed and there's another earthquake, a devastating
  thunderstorm, and yet another earthquake.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Then, a sign is spotted in the
  sky. It's the Virgin Mary, `clothed with the Sun, and the Moon under her feet,
  and on her head the crown of twelve stars', as John puts it. Another sign is
  seen: a huge, red dragon that uses its tail to throw one third of all stars
  (weren't they already gone?) to the surface of our pitiful planet. In a brief
  but fierce fight, the dragon along with several other demons is booted out of
  the sky. Unfortunately, they all fall down to earth. The dragon is in a bad
  mood. It declares war on the Virgin Mary and her likes.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">And when
  that happens, you'd better hide.</font> Out of the sea rises a huge beast,
  with seven heads and ten horns. (In a later chapter, John will explain that
  the ten horns are actually ten power-hungry kings without a kingdom.) The
  beast has `words of blasphemy' written on its seven foreheads, has the feet of
  a bear and the mouth of a lion. Don't try to kill it, you'll find that the
  head you're hacking off grows back on within moments.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="MS Sans Serif">If you can't beat 'em, join 'em,
  most people decide. They kneel in front of the beast, and decide to `adore'
  the dragon. The sea monster reigns for 42 months, speaking the curious
  combination of `great things and blasphemies'.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">Then a
  second beast hits the scene</font>, this time coming out of the earth and
  wearing two horns. The new beast takes over power from the sea monster, and
  demonstrates his supernatural talents, for one thing by letting it rain fire
  on earth. Understandably, the remnant of the earth's inhabitants accept the
  beast willingly as their new leader. They should have known better, though: the
  number of this beast happens to be 666. Although John never actually calls it
  that way, the beast is in our time often referred to as the antichrist.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Meanwhile, the 144.000 who still carry the
  mark of God on their foreheads decide they don't want to have anything to do
  with the beasts. On
  mount Sion, they team up with the divine lamb. Also joining are three angels,
  one of which sets out to warn the masses not to hang around with beast nr. 666
  anymore. Meanwhile, another angel reassures the 144.000 that the sinful city
  of Babylon will soon be destroyed. In yet another supernatural appearing,
  someone looking much like Christ descends on a cloud. Next, seven more angels
  appear, carrying seven divine plagues. Still following?</font></p>

  </div>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">Now, if
  you're one of those who take the antichrist beast for leader</font>, you're
  definitely in for trouble. The first angel strikes and wounds everyone. The
  second one turns the sea into blood, whereupon `every living soul' that
  happens to be in the sea drowns. The third angel turns all rivers and
  fountains on Earth into blood. The fourth angel harasses the population with
  heat and fire. The fifth angel brings darkness to the beast's kingdom. The
  sixth angel heads for the Middle East and dries up the river of Euphrates.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="MS Sans Serif">The unholy threesome -- the
  devil dragon, the antichrist and his false prophet, who is also there -- take
  up the glove, and declare an all-out war on God. They send out three ghostly
  frogs to convince all world's leaders to engage in the final battle. God in
  the meantime gathers his troops at a place which in Hebrew is called
  Armageddon (literally: the hill of robbers). And there's more voices and
  thunderstorms. Not to mention the biggest earthquake that ever shook the
  Earth, all previous apocalyptic earthquakes included. More cities crumble.
  Mountains collapse. Every island is swept from the face of the earth. And
  there's more hail, with hail stones as big as tennis balls.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">Another
  angel descends</font>, declaring the evil city of Babylon has just been
  destroyed, it only took one hour. Kings and merchants lament over the
  devastated city. A bright, avenging angel descends to lead the troops of God:
  it sits on a white horse, wears a blood sprinkled garment and has the dubious
  pleasure of carrying a two-edged sword in its mouth. Together with the others,
  the angel beats the antichrist and his false prophet and throws them into a
  pool of lava. If you were dumb enough to have joined the antichrist, you're
  dead: the angel with the sword slashes everyone and uses the corpses to feed
  the birds.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Now that the big part of the job
  is done, it's time to clean up the mess. Another angel comes down, ties the
  defeated devil dragon, tosses it back into the pit and shuts the lid. Not to
  be opened for another thousand years. Every martyr Christian that was ever
  beheaded comes back to life. Reunited, they live and reign for a thousand
  years.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">But time
  flies when you're having fun.</font> Suddenly, it's a thousand years later,
  and oh boy, the devil is at it again. He comes out of his pit and seduces all
  nations to join him in yet another war against the city of martyrs. But God
  himself puts the uprising swiftly to an end, by letting out a huge heavenly
  fire, which burns all the bad guys. This time, the devil himself is tossed
  into the pool of lava. The false prophet -- obviously, he survived the lava
  the first time --
  is taken captive. He will be tortured forever, John is told.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Now, it's time for the final
  judgment. All the dead rise, and are judged `according to their works'. Many
  are cast into the pool of lava, those who have an entry in the book of life --
  the chosen ones -- live forever.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">By now,
  our planet has underwent some radical changes.</font> There are no more seas,
  for instance. The skies open up, and an entire city -- the new Jerusalem --
  gently lands on earth. It is made of gold, has twelve foundations, twelve
  gates and twelve angels guarding the gates. People don't die anymore. And
  what's more, they don't suffer, cry or worry about anything anymore. There are
  no more murderers, sorcerers, liars and, notably, no more dogs. Also, there's
  no more day and night. The world bathes in the gloom of the glory of the Lord.
  `Behold, I make all things new,' God declares.</font></p>

  <p ALIGN="center"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><img border="0" src="apokal_sm.jpg" width="510" height="230"></font></p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></font></p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="4" color="#FFFF00">No,
  seriously: should we worry?</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="MS Sans Serif">All in all, the end of the world
  John foresaw is quite a ride. Interestingly, it lacks a well-defined chronology:
  the stars are swept from the sky again and again, the antichrist and his
  prophet die and come to life, people are killed in vast numbers, but in a next
  chapter, they seem to be doing just fine. According to theologists, this
  timelessness depicts the heavenly point of view of eternity.</font></p>

    </table>
  </div><font face="MS Sans Serif">But the lack of a clear
  chronology also makes the book prone to speculation: what apocalyptic state
  are we in today? Didn't we already have the diseases, hunger and war? And hold
  it, that Saddam Hussein guy, isn't he the antichrist?</font>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">Arguing
  like this, people have seen the antichrist in Napoleon, Stalin or Hitler</font>,
  while others have connected the emerging beasts with the US and the USSR, the
  German empire vs. the Allies, Saddam Hussein's Iraq vs. the UN, or Milosevich's
  Serbia vs. NATO.
  But let's assume John's vision is to be taken literally. Clearly, we would
  have noticed an earthquake that dislocates all mountains and islands on earth,
  an army of demon-like locusts attacking us and two comets that slam into our
  inhabited world -- to mention only a few.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Still, even today many
  Christians believe the world will end sooner or later, with or without all the
  monsters, earthquakes and supernatural battles involved. Mainly, this is
  because the the book is very abstract and obscure to an untrained reader. The
  Apocalypse is by far the most difficult, hard to understand Bible book of them
  all.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Bible scholars have pointed out
  that John wrote about the vision around 70 A.D., a time when Christianity was
  brutally being persecuted and actually in danger of becoming extinct for the
  first time. John, himself being captured and thrown into a pot of boiling
  water once, wanted to support his fellow believers. The Apocalypse was his way
  of saying: don't despair, we will win in the end.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">Interestingly</font>,
  the imagery from The Apocalypse is deeply imbedded in the religious traditions
  of John's time. As many scholars have argued, almost all beasts, eagles,
  locusts, dragons and acts of nature John describes stem from the long standing
  tradition of Jewish religious culture -- and even date back to the <a href="zarathushtra.html">Zoroastrianist
  apocalyptic</a> of the ancient Iranians. The symbol language John uses would clearly have been
  understood by the faithful from John's days.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="MS Sans Serif">So, should we really worry about
  antichrists and demons waging war on God? You guessed it: probably not. Well,
  don't be disappointed, there's plenty of other, more realistic apocalyptic
  scenario's left!</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Once, I visited <a href="http://www.esquilax.com/baywatch/index.shtml"> a personal
  homepage</a> where a movie fan brilliantly parodied all apocalyptic soothsaying.
  The guy that ran the page argued that television actor David Hasselhoff is in
  fact the devil. Among many other things, Hasselhoff definitely is the monster
  that comes out of the sea: he does it all the time in the <i>Baywatch</i>&nbsp;
  series. You may take the seven heads that keep growing back on for the seven TV-series
  he's in and that are constantly rerunning on television. And so on, and so on.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">Clearly,
  the guy has a point.</font> Translating abstract biblical vision into secular
  fact is a risky, haphazardous business. It can only lead to disconcern and
  more, hilarious speculations.</font></p>
