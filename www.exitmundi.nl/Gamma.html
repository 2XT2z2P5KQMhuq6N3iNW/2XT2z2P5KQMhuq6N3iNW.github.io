  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="MS Sans Serif">It was only recently scientists found out what gamma ray bursts really are.
  A GRB is what happens when a huge, dying star is eaten up from within by a
  black hole. One moment, you'll see a gigantic star, and the next moment,
  shhhhlllp!, it is gone, sucked up by a black hole. In those final moments, the black hole spews out a column of
  energy -- almost at
  light speed! That's why gamma ray bursts are often called 'the birth cries of
  black holes'. A less friendly, but more accurate, term would be that GRBs are
  belching black holes after they've eaten a star.<br>
  <br>
 Gladly, until now
  these super-spectacular things
  only happened in distant galaxies, billions of light years away.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">But then
  again, that could change.</font>   Heavy, rotating stars like the ones that
  cause gamma ray bursts exist in our part of the Galaxy, too. At least one is
  about to go pop: Eta Carinae, a beautiful, but dying star system in the
  southern constellation known as the Keyhole. Gladly, the burst won't hit us
  directly, since the axis of Eta Carinae is pointed away from us. But any day,
  we could stumble upon a dying star that IS aimed at us.<br>
  <br>
  On a list of twenty phenomena that
  threaten life on Earth published by the popular science magazine
  Discover, gamma bursters come second, right after <a href="Comets.html"> asteroid
  impacts</a>.
  As Arthur C. Clarke once pointed out, gamma explosions may be the reason why
  we don't notice much of extraterrestrial life forms: long before an alien civilization would have come to the
  point of going out in a UFO to explore the galaxy, a gamma ray burst would
  have wiped it away.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="MS Sans Serif">If a gamma ray burst really does go flash
  somewhere in our cosmic neighborhood, the end of times would be really nasty.
  It will be like a Hiroshima bomb going off -- on every place on Earth at the
  same time!<br>
  </font></p>
    <table border="0" align="right">
      <tr>
        <td><img border="0" src="gammaplaat1.gif" width="162" height="151" align="right"></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><img border="0" src="bd14868_1.gif" width="12" height="12"> <font color="#FFFF00" face="MS Sans Serif" size="2"><b>Flash!</b>
          - You're dead</font></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="MS Sans Serif">At a distance of something like one
  thousand light years, the afterglow of the burst would light up as bright as the Sun.
  Moments later, our planet will be bathed in a HUGE load of super energetic gamma and
  X-rays. A fiery blast will set the atmosphere ablaze. Forests will burn,
  rivers and lakes will boil away and the side of the Earth facing the blast
  will be sterilized immediately.<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#FF9900">And you won't be safe on the other side of the planet.</font>
  A massive shockwave, much like the aftershock of a nuclear explosion, will
  sweep across the globe. A wall of fire will roast every living thing on Earth
  -- well, except a few fish, that is. The Gamma Ray Burst will reset evolution.<br>
  <br>
  Even a blast occurring farther out in the Milky Way won't be good for our
  health.
  OK, so the burst is too far away to fry us. But still, it will mess up our
  atmosphere. The energetic gamma rays will grind up the molecules our
  atmosphere is made of into separate molecules of nitrogen and oxygen. These
  atoms in turn will mop up the ozone layer, leaving us exposed to the deadly UV
  radiation from the Sun.<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#FF9900">And if that isn't enough to kill you, there will be the
  soot.</font> High up in the atmosphere, the loose atoms will bind up into
  nitrogen dioxide, a brown, filthy gas that will blanket the Sun. We'll have a
  massive <a href="nukes.html">nuclear winter</a> and die a horrible climate
  disaster death.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">To make
  things worse, no
  one really knows how big the risks are</font>. On the one hand, gamma ray
  bursts that damage our world are likely to happen once every 10 million years
  on average. That would mean our planet has survived many, many bursts in the
  prehistoric past.<br>
  <br>
  On the other hand, it's hard to predict when the next GRB will hit us. Could
  be in million years time. Could be tomorrow.</font></p>
