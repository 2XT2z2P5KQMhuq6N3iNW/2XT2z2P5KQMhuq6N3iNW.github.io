  there's volcanoes and VOLCANOES.</font> In 1783, the Laki volcano in Iceland
  erupted, belching up almost five cubic kilometers of super hot lava. Nine
  thousand people perished on the spot, eighty percent of all livestock was
  killed, a quarter of Iceland's population was killed in the aftermath, and
  dust blocking the Sun pushed down temperatures several degrees on the entire
  northern hemisphere. Now, that's what a geologist would call a <b> small</b> volcano, a pimple

  different it was 65 million years earlier, when a volcano made a mess of what
  is now India. For several centuries in a row, the volcano pumped up something
  like 400,000 cubic kilometers of molten rock -- the Iceland eruption 100,000
  times over! Some scientists still blame the volcano, and not the comet, for
  the extinction of the dino's.<o:p>

  <b>
  supervolcanoes</b> can be, well, a little problematic. Ordinary volcanoes
  just pinch a tunnel in the Earth's crust. But a supervolcano is a completely
  different thing. A supervolcano is what happens when pressure builds up in an
  underground lake of magma. A supervolcano is much like a high-pressure balloon
  full of lava exploding. When it erupts, it really ERUPTS.<o:p>

  we'd run away, right?</font> Hmm. If only it was that easy. An even bigger
  problem than the lava itself is the ash. 64,000 Years ago, a supervolcano made
  a mess of what is now the US. Of the current 50 states, 21 were covered with a
  layer of ash, at some places was over twenty meters thick!<br>
  <br>
  Well, who cares, you might think - we'd just dust it away. But it isn't that
  simple. Volcanic ash is not like the ash you find on the barbecue: it is made
  of tiny pieces of rock. If it falls on your roof, your house can collapse
  under it's weight. If it gets into contact with cars or airplanes, they will
  break down or crash. Even worse, if you inhale it, the ash will mix with the
  liquids in your lungs and form a cement-like substance. You'll literally drown
  in conrete!<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#FF9900">So you'd take a boat to another continent, right?</font>
  Wrong. Apart from lava,
  volcanoes spew out a deadly brew of toxic chemicals. There are sulphurous
  gases that turn all rainfall into a blistering downpour of pure sulphuric acid
  for years to come. There are all kinds of chlorine-bearing compounds, that
  break down enough of
  the ozone layer to turn the Sun into a real killer. There's carbon dioxide,
  the greenhouse gas that not only nibbles at the ozone layer, but also causes
  long-term global warming. And last but not least, there's soot. A super
  eruption will darken the Sun, and gradually push the Earth into <a href="nukes.html">nuclear
  winter</a>. For many years, or even centuries, we will have to survive in
  darkness and cold.<o:p>

  we may be smart enough to escape from the lava and the ash, dodge the acid rains, survive the
  nuclear winter and protect ourselves against the killer solar radiation
  afterwards. But plants and animals definitely are not. We'd find ourselves in
  an increasingly empty world, as one species after another goes extinct. In the
  end, even the toughest survivalist would starve to death.

  In the scientific journal <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/">Science</a>, a
  team of US researchers led by Luan Becker report the finding of so-called
  fullerene molecules in geological layers connected to the extinction. These
  molecules are usually found in deep space -- so they must have been brought
  here by an asteroid, Becker argues. However, there's plenty of evidence a
  supervolcano did erupt in Siberia around that time, for one thing because
  there's lava all over the place. As Becker sees it, the Siberian eruption was
