  wanted to visit the South Pole? Well, here's the good news: soon, the South
  Pole could visit you. It's Thursday the 9th of September 2040, and we're in
  for a big surprise.</font><o:p>

  9/11/2040 has inspired a broad range of researchers and publicists to preach
  doom and destruction. And no wonder. In the early morning hours of this particular
  Thursday, a rare cosmological event will take place. All visible planets --
  Mars, Saturn, Jupiter, Mercury and Venus -- will align with both the Sun and
  the Moon.<o:p>
  They will be in an exact row.</o:p>
  </font></span></p>

  won't be able to see much of it, since the brightness of the Sun will make the
  view on everything else impossible. But according to the doomsayers, we will
  definitely notice something. Just picture this: there's SEVEN huge objects in
  the sky, tugging at our tiny planet with their combined gravities. This will
  cause the Earth's axis to tilt, moving Middle Africa to the North Pole and the
  icy Antarctic to the equator.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;tab-stops:-72.0pt -36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">It
  will be quite a disaster.</font> Rapidly, the ice caps of the poles will melt,
  causing massive floods and huge tsunamis all over the world. Millions will drown,
  entire continents will be flooded. Not to mention the faith of those poor Africans
  and Latin Americans, who will suddenly find themselves living on one of the
  poles!</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;tab-stops:-72.0pt -36.0pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><span lang="EN-US" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">And
  that's just the beginning. The tidal forces of the seven heavenly bodies combined
  will trigger earthquakes bigger than we've ever had. Also, there will be
  volcanoes erupting everywhere. If you don't drown, chances are you're crushed
  by a collapsing building or covered in lava. Well, if that isn't what you
  call `the end of the world', what is?<o:p>

  wait -- it could get even worse. Perhaps our planet will be torn apart, some
  doomsayers claim. The gravitational forces may literally rip our planet in
  two, cleaving it like a cabbage head. It would be an incredible mess, with
  little chance of survival.<br>
  <br>
  Another unpleasant possibility is that our planet is pulled
  out of orbit, and moved into a wider one. It would become so cold on earth, it
  wouldn't matter anymore if you were on the South Pole or not. Everything would
  freeze, and our atmosphere would vanish, making life on Earth impossible.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;tab-stops:-72.0pt -36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif">The
  gruesome scenario of September 2040 has been laid down in detail by many
  publicists, among others by Richard Noone in his book `Ice: The Ultimate
  Disaster'. According to Noone, the planets haven't aligned in many thousands of years.
  Last time it happened, says Noone,
  it caused Noah's flood. And as you know, a LOT of people had trouble facing
  that flood.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;tab-stops:-72.0pt -36.0pt"><img border="0" src="allignment.jpg" width="245" height="164" alt="Aligment" align="left"><span lang="EN-US" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif" color="#FF9900">Oh,
  but it also could turn out quite differently. For example, nothing at all
  might happen.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;tab-stops:-72.0pt -36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif">For
  one thing, Noone is dead wrong in claiming
  that the alignment is rare. In the 1960s, a Belgium astronomer named Jean
  Meeus calculated that precisely the same event as the one of September 2040
  took place no less than nine times since the year 1000 AD. For example, a
  seven-body alignment took place on February 5th, 1962. And as far as we know,
  no poles melted away that day, nor were there any earthquakes or volcanic
  eruptions.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;tab-stops:-72.0pt -36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Although
  Saturn and Jupiter are BIG planets, they are simply too far away to do us any
  harm. Their gravitational pull, even if combined, is only a tiny fraction
  of the gravitational pull the Sun and the Moon exert on our planet. And as you
  know, these two objects don't kick the Earth's axis over. The only thing we
  do notice, is the changing of the tides.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;tab-stops:-72.0pt -36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">And
  if you STILL are in doubt, there's this.</font> In fact, we have been lying to
  you a
  bit. Richard Noone didn't write a book about 2040. His scenario of
  quandary and blight dealt with another date: the 5th of May 2000. On that day,
  the super alignment took place, too. And as you should be
  able to remember, nothing happened on that day either. <o:p>

  doomsday cancelled? Well, just wait and see. You can safely assume that when
  2040 comes around, there will be some new Richard Noones around, advising us
  to put on scuba.</font></span>
