  </div>Oh,
    that good old Koran story about the end of days! The end of times as
    outlined in Muslim writings is one of the very finest religious apocalyptic
    scenario's around: rich in detail, vivid, and far reaching in religious
    implications. No wonder so many Muslims are deeply convinced judgment day
    (`Qiyamah', in Koran terminology) will come about one day.<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </font></span>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;mso-hyphenate:
none"><span lang="EN-US" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif">So
    here's what will happen. The Koran discernes `minor' and `major' omens
    predicting the end of days. Many of the `minor' omens (there are 72 signs in
    total) are already here for everybody to be seen. Men will behave more like
    women and women will imitate men. Men will dress in silk. Children will be
    disobeyant, and youngsters will be role-models. People who used to be
    shepherds will build tall buildings.<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </font></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;mso-hyphenate:
none"><span lang="EN-US" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif">And
    there's more. Many will engage in dangerous sports, divorces will be a daily
    occurrence and people will favour their friends over their families. Liquor
    will be consumed in the streets, and dancing and wild music will be
    everywhere. Religious leaders will make worldly profits, while intellectuals
    rather engage in science than in the study of religion. Also, there will be
    the usual apocalyptic rumble-a-bumble: earthquakes, devastating wars, storms
    and floods. If you add things up, it looks like the end of days is quite
    near, don't you think?<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </font></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;mso-hyphenate:
none"><span lang="EN-US" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">Well,
    don't worry -- yet.</font> When time's up, you can't miss it. For the signs will
    become more and more grotesque. One after another, they roll in like `a
    string of beads falling one after the other', as the prophet Muhammad put
    it.<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </font></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;mso-hyphenate:
none"><span lang="EN-US" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif">As
    a first sign the countdown to doomsday is ending, nature displays some very
    odd phenomena. You'll notice red winds sweeping across the country. Some
    people find their face gets malformed -- hey, isn't that a pig's face?
    Others are even less fortunate: everywhere, people are suddenly swallowed
    into the ground.<o:p>
    </o:p>

    a cataclysmic religious war breaks out. It's Muslims versus Christians, and
    soon after the outbreak of war, half of the Christian armies sign a peace
    treaty with the Muslims. The Muslim-Christian coalition conquers Istanbul,
    while the `bad' Christians conquer Syria. But that all changes when the
    Christian army starts heading for Mecca. Suddenly, the ground cracks open
    and gone are the Christians.<o:p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;mso-hyphenate:
none"><span lang="EN-US" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Well,
    that doesn't mean war is over. The Muslims raid the Middle East, lose two
    thirds of their army but in the end win back Syria and Palestine.
    Immediately, they declare Holy War (Jihad) on India -- and win.</font></span><font face="MS Sans Serif" color="#FF9900" size="4"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"><o:p></span></font><font face="MS Sans Serif"><span lang="EN-US" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"></o:p>

    find all this warfare a bit boring? Just wait, more miraculous things are
    about to happen. As peace settles down in the Muslim empire (that by now
    stretches from the Middle East deeply into Asia), the world is plagued by a
    severe drought that lasts three years.<o:p>

    that, suddenly a very creepy character shows up.</font> Al-Dajjal is his name. And
    he actually is the Muslim anti-Christ. Well-educated Muslims will instantly
    recognise the guy: he is short, red-faced, has hair that sticks up and is
    blind at the right eye. The false prophet inspires vast amounts of followers
    anyhow: 70,000 heavily armed believers join the bad guy.<o:p>
    </o:p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;mso-hyphenate:

    in the meantime another chap comes to power: Al-Mahdi. Now Al-Mahdi is there
    to keep the balance between good and bad. He is a military leader, is named
    after the prophet and of course calls everyone to the true Islam as often as
    he can.<o:p>
    </o:p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;mso-hyphenate:
none"><span lang="EN-US" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif">It
    takes a third miracle man to break down the stalemate between Al-Dajjal and
    Al-Mahdi: Jesus. Yes, you read that right: when the world is about to end,
    Muslims too expect Jesus -- `Isa' in the Koran -- to return from heaven. It
    is a miraculous thing to see, since Isa returns with much dramatic display:
    he descends from the sky in Damascus while a mass prayer is going on. If
    you're a Christian, you're in for a big surprise: without an eye's blink,
    Jesus denounces Christianity and calls upon everybody to convert to Islam.<o:p>

  </div>And
    Jesus is in a fighting mood.</font> He turns out an excellent military leader, as
    he goes out to pick a fight with Al-Dajjal. While more and more people
    convert to Islam, Isa defeats the false prophet. Jesus kills Al-Dajjal
    himself. It happens in the valley of `Ifiq', near an Israeli airport.<o:p>
