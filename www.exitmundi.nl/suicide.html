Well: somewhere in the distant future, we
  might come to the conclusion that it’s the
  best thing to do. The only thing that makes sense. We would decide to kill
  ourselves -- and do it. We'd kill ourselves collectively, to the last man. We wouldn’t even leave a suicide note. After all,
  who would read it?</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="MS Sans Serif">Of course, it won’t
  happen tomorrow. First, a lot of dramatic changes will take place to our
  species. Right now,
  we’re not too keen on dying. In fact, we hate it when we die!</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="MS Sans Serif">But most scientists
  expect that over time, this will
  change. Slowly, we will defy death. We will beat disease after
  disease, and live longer and longer. We will fool the Grim Reaper with
  anti-ageing chemicals and fantastic, new cures.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">And in the end, we
  will beat Death.</font> We will need all our technological know-how to do it. In the long run, we
  will replace our entire bodies by technology. Already, we replace our teeth
  and the occasional limb that has gone missing with artificial stuff. In the
  near future, science expects to invent replacements for our organs. A little
  later, and we will be able to replace our brain by computer technology.
  Really! Already, some futures researchers expect that by the year 2050, we
  will be able to upload our mind into a computer! We will <a href="borg.html" target="_self"> become machines</a> </font>--<font size="3" face="MS Sans Serif">
  and be immortal.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="MS Sans Serif">Trust us: it’s
  gonna be fun. When our minds have become pieces of software, we will be able
  to copy ourselves! We will be able to upload ourselves to... well, whatever
  we like. We will go out in space, in the shape of a conscious space ship. Or
  in the form of a purple cloud of thinking smoke particles. No, seriously!
  Respected scientists like Freeman Dyson and Carl Sagan already wrote about
  this in the 1970s.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="MS Sans Serif">And we will interact
  with each other, big time. With our biological bodies gone, we will no longer
  need MSN, Hyves or Myspace to get in touch with each other. Rather, our minds
  will start to... well, blend, actually. We will become one consciousness. Some
  researchers have dubbed this The Singularity, as we detail <a href="singularity.html" target="_self"> elsewhere on this
  site</a>.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="MS Sans Serif">Ok, that sounds
  pretty
  vague -- but hey, it’s no reason to kill yourself! Well: there is this one
  crucial detail. Once we’re immortal, we’ll be booooooored!</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">To us simple, mortal
  humans </font> this may be a bit hard to grasp. But once we’ve reached Perfection
  and Singularity and Oneness and all that blah blah, we will have no goal in
  life. Yes, we will go out and discover the Universe. But after a while, we
  will have seen it all. </font><font face="MS Sans Serif">W</font><font size="3" face="MS Sans Serif">ith our mortal bodies gone, we will have all the time
  of the Universe. We will know every corner of the Universe and say: so what?
  Why search any further? To an intelligent cloud of smoke particles, searching
  every corner of the Universe will make as much sense as examining every blade
  of grass on Earth makes to us.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="MS Sans Serif">So there you have it.
  You’ve become a God-like purple space cloud, but now you find that it is
  soooooo depressing.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="MS Sans Serif">And in fact, it’s
  even worse than that. Once we will become machines, our processing speed will
  increase hugely. Simply put, we will think bloody fast. Within a split second,
  we will realize that our existence, literally, has become useless. A split
  second later, we will realize it’s best if we didn’t exist.</font></p>

          <font face="MS Sans Serif" size="2" color="#FFFF00"><b>Brothers, Kill Thyself</b>
          - In the Japanese cult movie Suicide Club (2002), people commit mass
          suicide. In reality, mass suicide could be the natural outcome of
          evolution.</font></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="MS Sans Serif">To a Purple God Cloud
  suicide will be as self-evident as tossing away a used scrap of paper. As logical as getting off a train that has reached its final
  destination. And the final destination is what we will have reached: the
  endpoint of evolution.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">Even harder to
  comprehend</font>, the God Cloud won’t have any special feelings about it. When we
  think of suicide, we immediately think of terrible things with high buildings and shotguns. But
  when you're a Purple Cloud, it’s all very different. Conscious clouds don’t feel pain
  and have no reason to be afraid, least
  of all of death.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="MS Sans Serif">If you’re immortal,
  dying might seem like a fun thing to do! It will be as challenging as it is
  for
  us <i>not&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>to die.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="MS Sans Serif">So, there we go.
  After a long period of contemplation -- say, an entire millisecond -- we will realize
  we have become useless. Right there on the spot, we will kill
  ourselves.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="MS Sans Serif">And hey, you’re
  doing it again! You picture a purple cloud, desperately weeping, throwing itself in front of
  a speeding train. But it won’t be like that at all. Rather, we will terminate
  ourselves in some way yet beyond our imagination. We will step out of the
  Universe, fold ourselves up, switch ourselves off -- something like that. In
  a split second after we’ve reached immortality and Oneness and all that, we
  will be gone. Click. Puff. Exit.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" color="#FFFF00" size="4">The
  Games Alternative?</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">So
  -- is that it?</font> Is
  suicide the inevitable outcome of evolution? Well, actually: there is at least
  one other way out. But this route is so strange and so disturbing, that it will blow
  your mind. For your own sake, we ask you: if you’re mentally unstable or if
  you have
  a history of psychiatric disorders, please don’t read any further. It’s at your own
  risk.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="MS Sans Serif">For what else is
  there to do if you’re a Super Bored Super Human? What do <i>you&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>do
  when you’re bored? Indeed: you distract yourself. You play a video game, go
  out, or
  watch TV.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="MS Sans Serif">Exactly this is what
  a superhuman intelligence may do as well. But of course, it will seek
  distraction in a superhuman
  way: it will create a new Universe, break down its intelligence into bits, and seed
  the new Universe
  with the spores of its Presence. Basically, such a ‘game’ will be a
  Universe that is destined to bring forth life and intelligence.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">But wait a minute...
  </font>
  Isn’t that exactly the kind of Universe we’re living in?</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="MS Sans Serif">As we outline <a href="Dreamsend.html" target="_self">
  elsewhere on this site</a>, it is. Scientists have noticed for long that our
  Universe looks chillingly artificial. The way its parameters are set, and the
  way it is functioning suggest that something or someone has tinkered with it.
  Everything we see and feel and experience - it could be an illusion! We may be part of
  a kind of Sims Game, played by some kind of Superhuman
  intelligence...</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="MS Sans Serif">It
  would get weird when we reach Superhumanity again. We’d ask
  ourselves: &quot;Ok, what’s it gonna be? Another game of Universe? Or should we
  kill ourselves now?&quot;</font></p>
