  odd: you can worry about meteors and cosmic explosions all you want, but the biggest
  killer of all times is already here -- and is doing fine. In fact, life's
  oldest and most deadly enemy is preparing for yet another devastating attack
  on the human race. Diseases -- don't ever underestimate them.</font><o:p></o:p>

  and germs have always lived side by side. But every once and a while, the
  germs attack. Then, suddenly, there's AIDS, or SARS, or what-have-you.<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#FF9900">And SARS is still a relatively mild, merciful disease</font>.
  The Black Plague killed hundreds of millions of people, at its
  high-day ridding Europe of a quarter of its population. The Spanish flu that ran rampant
  in 1918 killed twenty to forty million men, quadrupling the death toll of
  World War One.
  </font></span><span lang="EN-US" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif"> In the US alone, the
  epidemic killed more people than World War
  II, the Korean war and the Vietnam war combined.<br>
  <br>
  Sure,
  our doctors like to reassure us that everything is under control by now. No
  offense -- but that's a lie. The grim reality is that our world is more
  vulnerable to disease than ever.<br>
  <br>
  That's because our world is so densely populated. Intensive agriculture brings humans
  closer to animal pathogens. And people themselves are a sociable species,
  constantly interacting with each other, and traveling around the globe all of
  the time.

  And the diseases? Haven't we seen them all by now? And cured them? Well: we haven't.
  The big problem
  is that viruses and microbes aren't inert, lifeless
  things. They live. And like all that lives, they evolve.<o:p></o:p>
  <br>
  <font color="#FF9900"><br>
  That's
  why there will always be new diseases.</font>  Evolution constantly throws
  new, lethal germs at us. Suddenly, some innocent animal virus 'jumps' the
  species barrier and begins to slaughter humans. AIDS started out as an
  innocent monkey disease, the Spanish flu of 1918 jumped from pigs to humans,
  Ebola probably comes from bats and SARS is closely related to a virus that
  lives in ducks and cows.<o:p></o:p>
  <br>
  <br>
  And don't look now: this 'jumping' happens all the time. Apart from SARS, AIDS
  and Ebola, recent years saw the coming of exotic, lethal germs like the
  Marburg virus, the Sin Nombre virus ('virus without a name'), Lassa fever,
  Nipah virus and Hendra virus - to mention only a few. And it isn't exactly
  comforting to know that some diseases kill virtually everyone they infect -
  like AIDS.<br>

Or consider the flu.</font> Say 'influenza', and you tend to think of a mild disease.
  But in fact, the flu is by far the most lethal opponent of human life on Earth.<font color="#FFFFFF">
  In it's lethal, 'Spanish Flu' form, influenza causes you
  to die a horrible death. N</font>o, you just DON'T want to know the details.<br>
  <br>
  Ok, you do. In
  a matter of days, you'll see your hands and feet turn black, as they literally
  begin to rot away. You'll cough up blood and lung tissue. You'll have seizures
  and hallucinations, as the fever boils your brains. And in the end,&nbsp;
  you'll slowly drown, as your lungs are filled with slime and discharge.
  &quot;Terrible names were whispered&quot;, a witness to the 1918 epidemic
  wrote. &quot;This was not influenza. This was a plague. The world was coming
  to an end.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  Clearly, there's no underestimating influenza. The virus is highly contagious,
  incurable and can kill up to ninety percent of those infected. And it is the
  fastest evolving thing we know of. This makes it move frighteningly fast,
  constantly jumping from one species to the other.<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#FF9900">In 1997, 1998 and early 2003, new strains of influenza
  jumped from chickens to humans</font> in Hong Kong, killing eight people in
  total. In April 2003, another bird flu strain contaminated eight people and
  killed one in Holland. In all cases we were lucky: the flu didn't combine with
  a human flu virus, turning it into a virus that's contagious for men.<br>
  <br>
  But it is a matter of time before it does. Then, we'll have a monster on our
  backs. SARS, anthrax and smallpox could be just flimsy colds, compared to the
  next strain of killer flu. In fact, the new strain of 2003 is still very
  active today, in Asia. Virologists are really worried.</font></span>

  if that didn't frighten you yet,</font><font color="#FFFFFF"> there's the
  eerie possibility that a notorious `old' disease such as the measles,
  cholera, tuberculosis, smallpox or, yes, the Black Plague suddenly makes a comeback.
  </font> A
  lot of germs are about to become resistant to drugs such as antibiotics. This is one of the BIG concerns of medicine
  today. In Japan and in Africa, the first strains of `invulnerable'
  superbacteria have already made some victims.<br>
  <br>
  One of them is MRSA, a notorious&nbsp;hospital bacterium that is
  resistant to most antibiotics. Luckily, it is a rather obscure bacterium, that
  usually hits the sick and the elderly. Then, in early 2003, something really
  awful happened. Suddenly, MRSA started to infect the healthy, causing terrible
  sores and abscesses.

  could suddenly kick the bucket. And the bad thing is:
  no-one knows when, where and how it will go wrong.<br>
  <br>
  However,
  there's one small comfort. It is very unlikely a disease will wipe out the
  human race altogether. No matter how massive the attack of the germs is, there
  will always be individuals around that are somehow fit enough to fight the disease
  -- and survive. Well, at least that's how things went until now.<o:p></o:p>
