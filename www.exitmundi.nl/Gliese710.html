<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial" size="3">For an
  object that could one day smash our world to bits, the star has a pretty dull
  name: ‘Gliese 710’. Most people probably have never heard of the thing.
  But that will change over time, as Gl-710 gets nearer. And nearer, and nearer.
  You see, Gliese 710 is rushing straight towards us, at the breathtaking speed
  of 50,400 kilometers per hour – almost fifty times the speed of sound.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial" size="3">Gliese 710
  is a dull, red dwarf: a small, dim star. It only shines with four to
  five percent of the Sun’s luminosity, while it’s mass is only half that of
  the Sun. So why worry, you ask? Hold on: it’s still a STAR we’re talking
  about here! And that's not the kind of object you want to find in your backyard
  in the morning: Gliese 710 is more than fifty times as big as the Earth, and
  more than 100,000 times as massive. Oh, and it BURNS!</font></span></p>
  <div align="right">
    <table border="1" cellpadding="2" width="168" align="right" bordercolor="#666666">
      <tr>
        <td width="100%"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial" size="3"><img border="0" src="gliesecloseup.gif" width="168" height="184"></font></span></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial" size="3"><font color="#FF9900">Gladly,
  we’ll have 1,4 million years before catastrophe strikes.</font>  What's
  more, Gl-710 is destined to pass us
  at 40,000 times the distance between Earth and the Sun, in what you could call
  a complete miss. But wait - there's something else.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial" size="3">Most
  likely the Death Star will mess up the pile of cosmic debris called the Oort
  Cloud a bit, and start throwing planet-sized chunks of rock at us. For tens of
  thousands of years in a row, we’d have to shelter for incoming comets. Our
  planet could get <a href="Comets.html">hit</a>, or an exploding comet could <a href="Kuiperbelt.html">block
  the Sun</a> and trigger a devastating <a href="Iceage.html">Ice Age</a> –
  much like the ominous, hypothetical space body called <a href="Nemesis.html">Nemesis</a>
  is held responsible for at least ten extinctions on our world.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial" size="3">Gladly,
  there’s also a possibility Gl-710 will do nothing nasty in particular. You
  see: incoming stars from many light years away are always a bit hard to
  predict. So in the end, Death Star may simply miss our Solar System
  completely.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial" size="3"><font color="#FFFFFF">Then
  again, of course it could also be the other way around.</font> Perhaps the
  calculations are wrong for the worse – and Gl-710 smashes into our Solar
  System directly. The dreaded thing would start gobbling up planets, or kick
  our poor Earth away into deep space. We would be incinerated, or deep frozen, or if
  we’re really having a bad day, both.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><img border="0" src="Gliese710kometen.gif" width="213" height="155" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial" size="3"><font color="#FF9900">And
  that's not everything. Gliese 710 is not the only star that’s coming our
  way</font>.
  During the next million years, at least eight stars will come closer to us
  than our current closest neighbor, Proxima Centauri at 4,3 light years. One
  of them, a red dwarf called Barnard’s Star, will arrive in only 10,000 years
  time. After that, a massive twin star system called Alpha Cen A/B will come
  knocking at our door. Calculations show the system is massive enough to give
  the Oort Cloud a good stir. Better keep those hard hats within reach, folks!</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial" size="3">And how
  about this? There’s always the remote possibility Gl-710 or one of the other
  incoming stars is surrounded by planets. And that some of these planets are
  inhabited worlds. As you can read <a href="et.html">elsewhere on this site</a>,
  the chances that this life is intelligent are vanishingly small. But for
  arguments sake: suppose it is. What would it do if it found us on their way?
  What would <i>you </i>do?</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial" size="3">As every
  science fiction freak can tell you: it’s probably not a good idea to be a
  stand in the way for some kind of Klingon civilization.</font></span></p>
