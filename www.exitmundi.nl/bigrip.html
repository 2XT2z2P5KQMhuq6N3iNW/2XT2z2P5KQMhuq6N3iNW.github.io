here’s something different: what if we all killed ourselves in the end? We
agree: after all we’ve been through, it would be a ridiculous way to go. But
suicide could also be the inevitable, perfectly logical outcome of evolution...</span></font></span></p>
  </blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Long&nbsp;</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="MS Sans Serif">Mass suicide. Oh,
  come on! What on Earth would we do <i>that</i> for?</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="MS Sans Serif">Well: because
  somewhere in the distant future, we would reach the conclusion that it’s the
  best thing to do. The only thing that makes sense. We would decide to kill
  ourselves – and do it. We wouldn’t even leave a suicide note. After all,
  who will be there to read it?</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="MS Sans Serif">Of course, it won’t
  happen tomorrow. First, a lot of dramatic changes will take place. Right now,
  we’re not too keen on dying. In fact, we hate it!</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="MS Sans Serif">Luckily, that will
  change over time. Slowly, we will defy death. We will beat disease after
  disease, and live longer and longer. We will fool the Grim Reaper with
  anti-ageing chemicals and fantastic, new cures.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="MS Sans Serif">And in the end, we
  will beat Mr. Death. We will need technology to do it. In the long run, we
  will replace our entire bodies by technology. Already, we replace our teeth
  and the occasional limb that has gone missing with artificial stuff. In the
  near future, science expects to invent replacements for our organs. A little
  later, and we will be able to replace our brain by computer technology.
  Really! Already, some futures researchers expect that by the year 2050, we
  will be able to upload our mind into a computer! We will become machines –
  and be immortal.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="MS Sans Serif">Trust us: it’s
  gonna be fun. When our minds have become pieces of software, we will be able
  to copy ourselves! We will be able to upload ourselves into… well, whatever
  we like. We will go out in space, in the shape of a conscious space ship. Or
  in the form of a purple cloud of thinking smoke particles. No, seriously!
  Respected scientists like Freeman Dyson and Carl Sagan already wrote about it
  in the 1970s.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="MS Sans Serif">And we will interact
  with each other, big time. With our biological bodies gone, we will no longer
  need MSN, Hyves or Myspace to get in touch with each other. Rather, our minds
  will start to… well, blend, actually. We will become one consciousness. Some
  researchers have dubbed this The Singularity, as we detail elsewhere on this
  site.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="MS Sans Serif">Ok, that sounds very
  vague – but hey, it’s no reason to kill ourselves! Well: there is this one
  crucial detail. Once we’re immortal, we’ll be booooooored!</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="MS Sans Serif">To us simple, mortal
  humans this may be a bit hard to grasp. But once we’ve reached Perfection
  and Singularity and Oneness and all that blah blah, we will have no goal in
  life. Yes, we will go out and discover the Universe. But after a while, we
  will have seen it all. With our mortal bodies gone, we will have all the time
  of the Universe. We will know every corner of the Universe and say: so what?</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="MS Sans Serif">So there you have it.
  You’ve become a God-like purple space cloud, but only to find that it is
  soooooo depressing.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="MS Sans Serif">And in fact, it’s
  even worse than that. Once we will become machines, our processing speed will
  increase hugely. Simply put, we will think bloody fast. Within a split second,
  we will realise that our existence, literally, has become useless. A split
  second later, we will realise it’s best if we didn’t exist.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="MS Sans Serif">To a Purple God Cloud
  it will be as [vanzelfsprekend] as tossing away a scrap of [volgeschrveen]
  paper. As logical as getting off a train that has reached its final
  destination. And the final destination is what we will have reached: the
  endpoint of evolution.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="MS Sans Serif">Even harder to
  comprehend, the God Cloud won’t have any special feelings about it. When we
  think of suicide, we immediately think of terrible things like high buildings,
  speeding trains and shotguns. But to a Purple Cloud, it’s a different
  matter. Conscious clouds don’t feel pain have no reason to feel fear, least
  of all of death.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="MS Sans Serif">If you’re immortal,
  dying might seem like a fun thing to do. Just like to us it is a challenge <i>not
  </i>to die.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="MS Sans Serif">So, there we go.
  After a long period of contemplation – say, a whole millisecond – we will
  realise we have become useless. Right there on the spot, we will kill
  ourselves.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="MS Sans Serif">And hey, you’re
  doing it again! You picture a weeping purple cloud throwing itself in front of
  a speeding train. But it won’t be like that. Rather, we will terminate
  ourselves in a way yet beyond our imagination. We will step out of the
  Universe, fold ourselves up, switch ourselves off – something like that. In
  a split second after we’ve reached immortality and Oneness and all that, we
  will be gone. Click. Exit.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="MS Sans Serif">So – is that it? Is
  suicide the only inevitable outcome of evolution? Well, actually: there is
  another way out. But it is so strange and so disturbing, that it will blow
  your mind. Therefore we really urge you: if you’re mentally unstable or have
  a psychiatric history, please don’t read any further. It’s at your own
  risk.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="MS Sans Serif">For what else is
  there to do if you’re a Super Human that is Super Bored? What do <i>you </i>do
  when you’re bored? Indeed: you distract yourself. You play a video game, or
  watch TV.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="MS Sans Serif">Exactly this is what
  a superhuman intelligence may do. But of course, it will do so in a superhuman
  way: it will create a new Universe, break down its intelligence, and seed it
  with the spores of its Presence. Basically, such a ‘game’ will be a
  Universe that is destined to bring forth life and intelligence.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="MS Sans Serif">But wait a minute…
  Isn’t that exactly the kind of Universe we’re living in?</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="MS Sans Serif">As we outline
  elsewhere on this site, it is. Scientists have noticed for long that our
  Universe has unmistakable clues that it is artificial. Everything around us,
  everything you do or see or feel or experience, may be fake! We may be part of
  a kind of Sims Game, an illusion, set up by some kind of Superhuman
  intelligence long before the Universe began…</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="MS Sans Serif">Well, at least it
  would be a weird choice if we reach Superhumanity again. We’ll ask
  ourselves: “Ok, what’s it gonna be? Another game of Universe? Or should we
  go to bed now and kill ourselves?”</font></p>
