  this: inside a cup of hot tea, a ghostlike shadow slowly takes shape, and then
  -- pop, out of nowhere there's a lump of sugar. It's only one of many oddities
  to be discovered when time starts running backwards. Weirder still, physicists
  agree that one day in the future, this might really happen, when the Universe
  displays the freakish burp of nature known as the Big Crunch.</font><O:P>

  Universe began some ten billion years ago, with the Big Bang. Out of nothing,
  a bulb of tremendous energy set free. Matter didn't exist. The only thing
  there was, was intense heat, and particles.<O:P>

  the bulb was nothing. No time, no space -- as a matter of fact, not even a
  place where the word `nothing' would have any meaning. To ask what was
  `before' the Big Bang or what is `outside' the Universe is a meaningless
  question. It would be like asking what continent is south of the South Pole,
  or what Bill Gates did before he was born.<O:P>

  the Universe expanded, at immense speed. It began to cool down, and matter
  slowly started to take shape. After 100,000 years, the first atoms formed.
  After 1,000,000 years, the first star flickered up. After 3,000 million years,
  a small star that later would be called `Sun' was born. And another 5,000
  million years later, an astrophysicist named Edwin Hubble would prove there
  was such a thing as a `Big Bang' in the first place.<O:P>

  the Universe is still expanding, and cooling down. Time ticks. At least,
  that's what we experience from our point of view.<O:P>

  as we experience it is governed by <b>entropy</b>: the natural tendency of
  things to go into a more chaotic, less energetic state. That sounds more
  difficult than it really is. When you throw a coffee mug on the floor, it will
  break up into a chaotic configuration of splinters, while throwing a handful
  of splinters on the floor will not create a new a mug. When you put a lump of
  sugar into your tea, the sugar molecules want to mingle with the tea
  molecules, creating chaos. The only way to beat entropy is to invest energy --
  for example; by gluing the splinters of the broken mug together one by one.<O:P>
  </O:P>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: -72.0pt -36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="LETTER-SPACING: -0.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif">But
  in the end, entropy always wins. Mountains erode, the Universe cools, <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~mke/Sunburn.htm">the
  Sun cools and will one day die</a>, the Earth will eventually vanish, and all
  coffee mugs will some day be broken. Entropy is deepest, most profound driving
  force of the Universe. It defines time, ordering it to point towards what we
  call `the future'.<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: -72.0pt -36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="LETTER-SPACING: -0.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#ff9900">But
  then, out of the blue, something completely crazy happens.</font> Suddenly,
  the Universe stops expanding. And it actually starts <b>shrinking</b> again,
  like a balloon losing air.<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: -72.0pt -36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="LETTER-SPACING: -0.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Some
  cosmologists assume this will indeed be the case. There may be too much mass
  in the Universe for the expansion to go on forever. The gravity of all matter
  in the Universe combined may cause the inflation of the Universe to slow down,
  come to a halt -- and after that, the Universe would start shrinking again.<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: -72.0pt -36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="LETTER-SPACING: -0.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif">This
  would have unimaginable consequences. In a Universe that's contracting,
  everything goes reverse. The arrow of time points backwards. Amazingly,
  entropy would go the other way around.<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: -72.0pt -36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="LETTER-SPACING: -0.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif">So
  there it is, the <span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt" lang="EN-US">reverse-Universe.</span>
  There are lumps of sugar coming out of nowhere and pieces of pottery coming
  together to form a coffee mug. Light will be mysteriously attracted to the
  Sun, and sucked into it. Atoms will want to form molecules as difficult as
  possible. Out of dust, mountains will form. Rivers will flow backwards. And
  you'll have to add cold to keep your cup of tea from becoming so hot it
  vaporizes and flies off.<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: -72.0pt -36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="LETTER-SPACING: -0.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#ff9900">But
  you won't.</font> As a matter of fact, you won't do anything -- since you're
  probably not there anymore. Although some theorists believe that in a
  reverse-Universe,
  the dead would rise again, living reversed lives until they vanish into
  nothing, it is unlikely this will happen.<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: -72.0pt -36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="LETTER-SPACING: -0.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif">For
  one thing, our bodies simply may not be apt to contracting universes. The
  biological mechanisms in our bodies are run by entropy. We need entropy like
  we need oxygen. No entropy, no life.</font></span></p>
  <span lang="EN-US" style="LETTER-SPACING: -0.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><img border="0" src="sterrencrunch3.jpg" width="230" height="187" align="right" hspace="3" vspace="3">What's
  more, it will take a long, long time before shrinking day comes -- some
  estimates lead up to ten or twenty <b>trillion</b> years from now:
  20,000,000,000,000,000 years. By that time, our Universe will have changed
  completely. Entropy will have caused stars to fade out and black holes to
  vaporize. Matter will be divided evenly across the Universe. It will have no
  particular reason to form stars and planets or humans living backwards lives.
  Matter will just clot together, making a denser and denser Universe.<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </font></span>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: -72.0pt -36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="LETTER-SPACING: -0.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Admittedly,
  it's all speculative business. But don't bother, you won't miss a thing if
  you're not there when the Universe contracts. After some ten to twenty
  trillion years of rewinding, the Universe would eventually go zip, as if it
  never existed. It's the event known as the Big Crunch -- `crunch' in the mind
  of scientists apparently being the opposite of `bang'.<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: -72.0pt -36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="LETTER-SPACING: -0.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#ff9900">But
  will the Universe really vanish?</font> At the moment, most cosmologists don't
  think so. The latest evidence suggests that the Universe will keep expanding
  forever, becoming an ever emptier and colder place. Yes, that gives some
  problems of it's own -- but that's <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~mke/bigexpansion.htm">another
  story</a>. However, the question whether the Universe will shrink or expand
  forever is still not completely settled.<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: -72.0pt -36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="LETTER-SPACING: -0.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif">But
  then again, many theorists think that the Big Crunch won't be the ultimate
  end. As the Universe is shrunk back into a ridiculously tiny proportion known
  as the `Planck length', it would go Bang again. The Universe would expand once
  more, and everything would start all over again, ping-ponging us forwards and
  backwards in time forever.<O:P>
