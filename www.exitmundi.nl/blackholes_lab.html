  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif">It is one weird way to go. One

  </div>If you were to play back the
  tape of what went wrong very slowly, you would see something very peculiar.
  Suddenly, you would see the Earth deform. Obviously, not a very good sign. Our
  planet is flattened out to become a disk. Beams of radiation shoot up from
  where the poles used to be. And then, zzzp, the planet’s gone. Just like
  that. Within a split second, it would simply vanish, right before your eyes.</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">Understandably,
  on board the International Space Station, this will cause some confusion, to
  say the very least.</font>
  Astronauts will be stunned to find that their space ship suddenly no longer
  orbits a planet -- but, well, nothing much really. The only thing that is
  out there, is a tiny black spot, invisible to the eye. Still, the speck
  has the same mass as the Earth. For the time being, the Space Station
  will&nbsp; remain in orbit, just like the Moon and the satellites. A very
  silly thing to see, of course.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Perhaps some astronauts will realize
  what has happened. They might recall how back in the early 21<sup>st</sup>
  century, physicists tried to create baby black holes in the lab. And now, many
  years later... Well, the black holes obviously did show up, after all.</font></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Luckily, the chances of the
  disaster outlined above really happening should be vanishingly small. But:
  some risk is there all the same.</font></p>

  </div>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif">First, you should know that in
  principle, making a black hole is easy. Basically, the only thing you need to
  do is to slam two tiny, subatomic particles together in a particle
  accelerator. If you use enough force, the collision should yield a tiny black
  hole. (To find out what a black hole is, read our section on <a href="blackhole.html">black
  holes from space</a>).</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Until recently, most
  scientists believed creating baby black holes couldn’t be done on our planet.
  You would need a particle accelerator as big as the
  solar system, most scientists assumed. But nowadays, that's all changed. Quite
  a lot of physicists think a much smaller particle accelerator can do the
  trick, too. Such as the ‘Large Hadron Collider’ (LHC), a particle smasher
  to be opened in Switserland in 2007.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Luckily, a man-made
  black hole won’t be a roaring
  monster that gobbles up planets and stars. Rather, science expects an incredibly
  tiny baby black hole, much smaller than an atom. What's more, it should
  evaporate immediately</font><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">.</font> Black holes
  give off radiation. And our black hole would be so incredibly small and hot, it
  would radiate itself away in less than 0,00000000000000000000000001 seconds!
  That’s why physicists feel pretty confident about working with the LHC. No
  problem if a black hole shows up. According to the laws of physics, black holes from the lab just shouldn’t be
  stable.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">BUT. There is always a small
  possibility that the predictions are wrong.</font> Particle accelerators are there to
  break new ground -- to explore new physics. And the physics science is about
  to explore, is really new and exotic. Nobody has ever seen a mini black hole.
  In fact, no one has even the faintest idea how gravity works on very small
  objects.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif">So, it’s 2007, and science
  switches on its LHC. According to some calculations, this super particle
  accelerator could summon up one black hole every second! There they are: black
  hole, black hole, black hole; Pop! Pop! Pop! Now suppose that against all
  expectations, these baby black holes aren’t the fleeting, unstable mini
  monsters we expect them to be. Suppose they’re stable.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">At
  first, no one
  would notice.</font> They wouldn’t eat up the lab or something. Instead,
  they would escape. One by one, the baby black holes would leak away from the
  lab, going through concrete walls as if they didn’t exist. If you’re that
  small, traveling through solid objects is no problem: you just rarely bump
  into a molecule.<br>
  <br>
  And then? Slowly, our refugee black holes would begin to sink towards the
  center of the Earth, attracted by gravity. And there, they would sit and
  wait.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">But
  sooner or later, a hole will indeed bump into an obstacle</font>. An electron,
  or an atom’s nucleus -- tiny stuff like that. The black hole will swallow
  whatever it encounters. This will make it heavier. It will have more
  gravity, and pull in some more particles. It will get heavier still. And
  suck in more and more matter.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Eventually, the black holes
  will merge. They will suck up the Earth’s core, the mantle, and finally --
  the entire planet.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Gladly, it could take a baby
  black hole thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of years to mature. That
  should give us some time to learn more about them. But the bad news is that
  even in the distant future, there isn’t much we can do. You cannot find or
  catch a black hole that is so small you cannot even see it, and that hides
  deep within the molten iron core of the planet. The only option is to evacuate
  the planet, if we happen to discover the predictions were wrong.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><img border="0" src="black-hole-lab2.gif" align="center" width="384" height="262"></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif" color="#FFFF00" size="4">So,
  should we leave?</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Well, that’s hard to say. As
  far as we know, everything should be okay. Our world is constantly being bombarded
  by tiny, high energy particles from outer space. This should also create mini
  black holes, high up in the atmosphere: up to one hundred each year. And as
  far as we know, these black holes are indeed unstable. For the last 4,5
  billion of years, our planet didn’t die.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">On the
  other hand:</font> in physics, quite often, a totally unexpected, new
  phenomenon pops up. In recent years, physicists lifted their eyebrows over
  dark energy, the Pioneer anomaly, the missing of the Higgs boson, the
  pentaquark and the suspected drift of the fundamental constants. No, we're not
  going to explain all that -- but the bottom line is this: physicists are constantly
  being surprised by weird new stuff that wasn't in the theories yet.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Now, you don't want to be such
  a surprise to be a black hole
  that has our planet for breakfast!</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif">And then there’s this. In
  march 2005, scientists working on the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider in
  Upton, New York created a fireball that indeed looked awfully much much like a
  black hole.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="MS Sans Serif">It was unstable. In fact, it
  wasn't even a real black hole. Or so the
  scientists involved say. Perhaps the first man-made black hole is on its way to the center of
  the planet already!</font></p>
