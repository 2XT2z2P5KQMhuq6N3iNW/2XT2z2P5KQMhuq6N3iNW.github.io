  So, what if nothing really happens? What if the world isn't struck by meteors,
  destroyed by divine hand or blown to bits by scientists? Well, in the long
  run, we might sleep. Not just for the nights, but also during the day. We
  might even sleep our entire lives, from birth to death, without ever waking
  up. What's more: the survival of our species may depend on it.</font><o:p>

  Universe expands. Ever since the Big Bang blew all matter, space and time into
  existence, the Universe grows. The Universe expands and cools, much like the
  fire cloud after an explosion gets bigger and colder. And that's exactly what
  astronomers see as they study the sky: all stars we see rush away from us and
  from each other at tremendous speeds.</font></span></p>

  to the latest insights, the expanding and cooling of the cosmos will go on and
  on and on. Galaxies and stars will be further and further apart. Stars will
  slowly become dimmer, as they move out of sight. The night sky will become

  more, stars die. After a lifecycle of several to many millions of years
  (depending on their size), every star is destined to spew out its last bit of
  energy and collapse, becoming a cold `neutron star', a `white dwarf', or a
  black hole. As time passes, this will happen to more and more stars, creating
  a Universe full of burnt out dead stars and black holes.</font></span></p>

  star or planet can resist it. The increasing number of black holes will sweep
  the Universe clean, much like the devil in St. John's biblical vision of the
  Apocalypse sweeps the stars from the sky with its tail. It will become even
  darker still. And oh, by the way, <a href="Sunburn.html">our own Sun will die

  we'll find ourselves in the midst of an energy crisis of unimaginable
  proportions. And terrible enough, in all the dark and the cold, we need energy
  more than ever.<o:p>

  hack up some atoms in a nuclear power plant, you might say. But that's not a

  bizarre as it may sound, the supply of atoms is ultimately limited. The matter
  on our planet is, of course, finite. And in the nothingness of the faded-out
  Universe, matter is hard to get at. It's either beyond reach or eaten up by
  black holes. And there's no more particles raining down on our planet from
  solar radiation, meteors or cosmic dust.<o:p>

  the long run, we have to come up with something to adapt to our new
  environment. And `adapting' means more than getting used to cold feet and
  being able to see in total darkness: it means cutting drastically on our
  energy bill.</font></span></p>

  we'll have to get rid of our bodies. </font><font color="#FFFFFF">No, really!</font>
  Our carbon-based bodies are very vulnerable to cold. They get damaged even
  when temperatures drop only a few degrees. It's absolutely certain there's no

  okay. Grudgingly, you've turned yourself into a cyborg. But in the long run,
  even that isn't enough. For one thing, thought itself costs energy. Just think
  of your computer doing its calcu­lations: the thing simply wouldn't run if
  you didn't have it connected to a power source.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;tab-stops:-72.0pt -36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif">And
  what's worse, the universe gets colder still. This brings out other, very
  weird physical problems of its own. The speed of thought will drastically
  decline in extreme cold, Dyson demonstrated. So there you are, you've decided
  to become a cyborg, and now you find out you're sooooo slooow-witted.<o:p>
  </o:p>

  when temperatures drop even further, there's more trouble facing us poor
  former humans. It'll be so cold, even a cyborg would get into trouble. A point
  comes when organisms cannot lower their temperatures any further without
  becoming less complex -- in effect, dumbing down. Before long, life could no
  longer be regarded as intelligent.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;tab-stops:-72.0pt -36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif">It's
  here where sleep comes into play. As Dyson calculates, there's only one
  possibility to survive. We'd hibernate. By sleeping, our metabolic rates will
  drop, and we will be able to achieve an ever-lower body temperature. In fact,
  by spending an increasing fraction of our time asleep, eternal life would
  indeed be possible.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;tab-stops:-72.0pt -36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">So
  you've become a slow-thinking robot that's asleep most of the time.</font>
  Still, even that may not be enough. For example, what kind of alarm clock
  would you set to wake you up? Your alarm clock would have to operate reliably
  for a long, long time, using less and less energy. A curious but,
  scientifically speaking, dead serious problem, that no physicist has been able
  to answer yet.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span></p>

  then there's the problem of thought. In the early 1980s, computer researchers
  realized that in principle it's possible to design a computer that doesn't
  dissipate energy while processing information. Isn't that great news for all
  those dormant cyborgs to come?<o:p>
  </o:p>

  it isn't. To function, this computer -- that only is a theoretical possibility
  so far -- must never, NEVER discard any information. If it does discard only
  one bit of information, it will be like pulling the plug out of a bath tub: it
  would use up energy while calculating for ever more.<o:p>

  amount of particles. Even in your cyborg brain, there will come a point where
  you would have to discard old information in order to store something new. And
