  time, the trouble didn't come from some colossal piece of rock slamming into
  our planet, or from some divinity deciding to end our world. No, the danger
  was so small we didn't even see it coming. We're talking <b>quarks</b> here:
  the tiny building blocks that make up protons and neutrons.<o:p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;tab-stops:-72.0pt -36.0pt"><span lang="NL" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt;mso-ansi-language:NL"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Quarks
  come in different `flavors'. There's `up' quarks, and `down' quarks, and `strange' quarks. The nuclei of atoms are made of just the
  right mix of just the right quarks. Matter ultimately is made of `up' and
  `down' quarks.<o:p>

  other mixtures are possible too. In the first moments after the Big
  Bang, there also was stuff made of `up', `down' and `strange' quarks. It was a
  completely different kind of stuff than what we're used to. Appropriately,
  scientists call it <b>strange matter</b>.<o:p>

  as the universe expanded, strange matter vanished -- although some chunks of strange matter (called `S-curves') may still be out there
  somewhere. One thing's for sure, though: no human has ever actually spotted a
  single speck of strange matter.<o:p>

  but that can change.</font> In recent years, quantum physicists have tried hard to
  imitate the earliest moments of the Universe. That sounds more difficult than
  it is: the only thing you have to do, basically, is to slam two particles at
  tremendous speed head-on into each other. And that's exactly what they do at
  huge particle accelerators such as those at CERN in Geneva or the
  `Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider' (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory in
  New York.<o:p>

  already feel what showed up this morning.</font> Strange matter, my friend. LOTS of
  it.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;tab-stops:-72.0pt -36.0pt"><img border="0" src="strangeeiffel.jpg" width="157" height="226" align="left"></p>

  a particle accelerator experiment, a tiny bit of strange matter suddenly
  popped into existence. Against all expectation, it had a negative charge.
  The next moment, it engaged into a chain reaction theoretical physicists call
  `<b>Ice-9 Type Transition</b>'.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;tab-stops:-72.0pt -36.0pt"><span lang="NL" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt;mso-ansi-language:NL"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Sure,
  the lump of strange matter that showed up was incredibly small. But that
  changed within moments, as the `strangelet' began gobbling up all positively
  charged atomic nuclei it encountered, forming more strange matter. The blob
  grew and grew, eating the accelerator, the building around it, and the town
  around the building. It turned everything it encountered into more atom-eating
  strange matter. It was ice-9 at its best. Within seconds, our entire planet
  including everything on it became a strange matter planet.<o:p>
  </o:p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;tab-stops:-72.0pt -36.0pt"><span lang="NL" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt;mso-ansi-language:NL"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">Does
  that, er... <b>matter</b>?</font> Oh man, you just don't wanna know. All conventional
  atoms ceased to exist this morning. And in case you forgot, everything we know
  of, including us, is made of atoms. What's worse, strange matter particles are
  equally charged, making them want to go away from each other as far as
  possible, like the equally charged sides of a magnet. Simply put, all matter
  on the planet has fallen apart this morning. The world went boom, or whatever
  the sound was.</font></span></p>

  alright, I'll admit it.</font> Of course, nothing really happened today. I wouldn't
  be writing this if it had. But could it happen tomorrow? Or next week, next
  year?<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;tab-stops:-72.0pt -36.0pt"><span lang="NL" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt;mso-ansi-language:NL"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Here's
  some reassurance: strange matter is so unstable, it simply wouldn't have time
  to consume nearby atoms. What's more, strange matter probably has a positive
  charge. And positively charged strangelets aren't very dangerous. They would
  have an appetite for electrons, sure, but this wouldn't bring about a chain
  reaction. The strangelet would simply snatch away a few electrons from
  surrounding atoms, and that would be it.<o:p>

NL"><font color="#FF9900">Would, probably, perhaps.</font> Actually, no one knows for sure. As I already
  mentioned, no human being has ever studied a chunk of strangeness. And if
  scientific history has made one thing clear, it should be that reality often
  defies theory. As the Russian theorist Lev Landau once put it: `Cosmologists
  are often wrong, but never in doubt.'<o:p>
