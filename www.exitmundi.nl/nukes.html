All
  hell breaks loose. There's eye-popping flashes of light everywhere and
  ear-ripping bangs as the bombs go off. Cities evaporate. Infrastructures
  crumble. Everywhere, huge mushroom-shaped clouds tower up into the sky. All
  electricity goes out because of electro-magnetic effects. And of course, many
  die: according to even the mildest scenario's, hundreds of millions die
  instantaneously as the nukes go boom.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;mso-hyphenate:
none"><span lang="EN-US" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif">But
  you -- you survive all that. Better take shelter: for the next days, it will rain
  highly radioactive fall-out particles only. For almost three days and three
  nights in a row, it will rain radioactivity in a region several hundreds of
  kilometers around each impact site. And to be honest: it's best you stayed indoors for a whole year, patiently waiting until
  radioactivity levels finally begin to drop.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;mso-hyphenate:
none"><span lang="EN-US" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">But
  wait, there's more trouble</font>. As the mushroom clouds begin to fade, the
  REAL consequences of nuclear war become apparent. From the explosion sites,
  huge amounts of evaporated stuff, smoke and soot rise up into the sky. It's
  quite different from the usual smoke columns that come from fires. The intense
  heat from the nuclear impact sites pushes the debris straight into the highest
  parts of the atmosphere, the so-called <b>stratosphere</b>. There, it slowly starts
  to disperse, covering ever bigger portions of the world. But what's worse --
  the soot blocks the Sun.<o:p></o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;mso-hyphenate:
none"><span lang="EN-US" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Within
  days, a weird and unprecedented climate shift sets in. Total darkness covers
  everything. Temperatures drop rapidly. And chances are the soot blanket that
  prevents the Sun from shining spreads across the globe, transforming even the
  Latin Americas, Asia and Africa into chilly shadow worlds. There you have it:
  the infamous, dreaded <b> Nuclear Winter</b>.<o:p></o:p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;mso-hyphenate:

  weeks, it's minus 23 to 30 degrees Celsius everywhere. Do you live near the
  shore? Consider yourself lucky: since oceans cool so slowly, temperatures
  near the sea will drop `only' some five to ten degrees. But there is a
  downside: because of the big temperature differences between the sea and
  the inland, unimaginable storms and hurricanes will harass the coastal areas.</font></span></p>

  and that's just the beginning of your Winter out of Hell.</font> Slowly,
  particle-by-particle, the soot will begin to fall back to the Earth. The
  results are not what you call pleasant. When it rains, the rain consists of
  burning sulphuric acid. And when it doesn't rain, the wind blows huge amounts
  of tiny particles of radioactive dust into your face. There's not enough
  radioactivity there to kill you. But it won't do you much good either.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;mso-hyphenate:
none"><span lang="EN-US" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Meanwhile,
  you're not the only one having a hard time. Plants, living on sunlight and
  warmth, will die within weeks. Animals, relying on both plants and warmth, die
  too. Other animals perish because all water is frozen. After a
  couple of months, there won't be any birds anymore. And what's worse, the
  animals with the biggest chance to survive are not exactly what you call good company in the
  pitch-black darkness: insects, rats, flies and cockroaches. They have a great
  time, having all those dead bodies to feast on and no birds to hunt them down.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;mso-hyphenate:
none"><span lang="EN-US" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Oh,
  and talking of dead bodies: there will be outbreaks of all kinds of diseases.
  The radioactivity will speed up the mutation rate of viruses and bacteria
  tremendously. There will be outbreaks of all kinds of diseases, while it is
  more than likely all kinds of new diseases will pop up too. By the way,
  the radioactivity boosts the mutation rate of your own DNA as well -- which in
  effect means you'll develop all kinds of cancers and give birth to gruesomely
  malformed babies.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;mso-hyphenate:
none"><span lang="EN-US" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif">By
  now, you may start to wish those mean, black clouds that block the sun would
  bugger off. And eventually,
  they will. Depending on how many bombs exploded during the nuclear war, it
  will roughly take several months to a year before the sky starts clearing up
  again. But when it does, the end of all endurance is still not in sight.<o:p>
  </o:p>

none"><span lang="EN-US" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">One
  particularly nasty problem</font> is that the soot from the impact sites has
  wiped out most of the ozone layer by chemical reactions. And without the ozone
  layer, we're exposed to the malignant ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. The
  UV-radiation kills the plants that may still be there, and causes more cancers and
  even sores and burns among humans. For years and years to come, you'll have to
  take shelter when the Sun shines.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;mso-hyphenate:
none"><span lang="EN-US" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif">And
  for the long term? The prospects are grim. With society disrupted, the food
  chain torn apart and humanity diminished, we'll be lucky if we're `only'
  thrown back into the Stone Age. A lot of species will become extinct. We may
  very well be one of them.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;mso-hyphenate:
none"><span lang="EN-US" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">But
  wait a minute. Nuclear war, is that still possible?</font> The answer is a
  plain and clear `yes'. Sure, the Russians and the West more or less like each
  other now. But the world is still armed to the bone with some 50,000 nuclear
  warheads. Although there's no finger on the trigger right now, the trigger is
  still within reach -- and the gun is fully loaded.<o:p>
  And of course it doesn't really help more and more countries got nukes. India
  and Pakistan have at their disposal about a hundred nukes; thousands of
  nuclear weapons are spread over the many unstable countries that once made up
  the Soviet Union. </o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;mso-hyphenate:
none"><span lang="EN-US" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif">There's
  one reassurance, however. In principle, since its discovery in the 1980s,
  everybody knows what a Nuclear Winter is. You'd expect the world leaders
  to keep that in mind. The biggest nuclear weapons threat facing us right now
  is a small-scale nuclear war -- or a nuclear bomb attack by terrorists. But
  although that's awful enough, a small-scale nuclear war isn't enough to
  trigger a full-scale Nuclear Winter.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.0pt;mso-hyphenate:
none"><span lang="EN-US" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif">But
  then again, as history demonstrates, things can get out of hand really fast.
  One moment there's peace, and the next moment, there's war. So better go find
  those good old `Ban the bomb'-buttons of yours again!<o:p>
