  impact sends out a shockwave around the globe, just like a stone thrown into a
  pool makes a circle of waves. But this wave rolls through the Earth's crust
  itself, causing death and destruction everywhere. There are
  massive earthquakes. Huge tsunamis. Volcanoes popping open. Millions die, cities are shaken into
  oblivion. On the opposite side of our planet, the waves of destruction slam
  into each other again, causing the earth's crust to tower up, forming a

  that's just the beginning.</font> As the tremor and the seas calm down and the fires
  extinguish, there's more to deal with: the huge, black cloud of debris
  that's thrown up into the stratosphere from the impact site. The debris
  spreads through the stratosphere, covering the Earth with a thick blanket of
  burnt carbon, dust and debris. The Sun is blackened.<br>
  For months or even years to come, the world is covered in darkness, the Sun
  being no more than a vague blot of light in the pitch-black sky. Temperatures
  drop about twenty to forty or even fifty degrees everywhere. The Earth's
  surface freezes. Plants cannot produce oxygen anymore by photosynthesis and
  die. Animals relying on the plants die too. And we -- relying on both the
  animals and the plants -- are in BIG trouble.<o:p>

  they find their planet is turned into a barren, lifeless sheet of land, with

<span lang="EN-US" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><font color="#FF9900">All
  that changed in 1978</font>, when two paleobiologists, Louis and Walter Avarez, went
  to Italy to study the so-called <b>K/T barrier</b>: the transition between the
  Cretaceous period (the age of the dinosaurs) and the next prehistoric era, the
  Tertiary period. The K/T Barrier had always been a big mystery. Within only
  several thousands of years -- a twinkling of an eye, in geological terms --
  all the dinosaurs suddenly vanished and nature switched from one geological
  period to the next.<o:p>

  around in the Apennine Mountains, father and son Avarez suddenly realized
  something extraordinary must have happened. Everywhere on Earth, the K/T
  Barrier is marked by a tiny layer of iridium in the ground -- `iridium' being
  a rare chemical substance mostly found in meteorites. It began to dawn on
  Louis and Walter that the dinosaurs didn't just die out because of some
  evolutionary reason. The dinosaurs were simply squashed by a huge meteorite!<o:p>

  killer meteorite must have slammed into our planet 65 million years ago. It
  must have been an event much like the one described above. There was a long,
  mean period of darkness, while it rained iridium all over the world. Life on
  our planet was almost completely wiped out. All plants and animals bigger than
  a blade of grass became extinct. Just picture that! No wonder the Avarezes coined the killer meteor `<b>The Great Exterminator</b>'.<o:p>

  the decade to come</font>, the Exterminator theory was highly controversial. If a
  meteor big enough to kill all the dinosaurs really went boom on our planet,
  surely you should notice an impact crater somewhere?
  Then, in 1991, Nasa sattelites indeed spotted the crater.

  time in history, man could see what actually happens when a colossal comet
  starts to mess around with your planet. In July 1994, the meteor slammed into
  Jupiter's atmosphere, snapped into pieces, and bombarded the planet for days.
  Huge balls of fire and dust rose up from the planet's surface, and the debris
  darkened parts of Jupiter's atmosphere for weeks. The biggest impact crater,
  carved out by the piece of meteor known as Hale-Bopp, had a size no smaller
  than the entire Earth! By now, everyone realized that the danger of a meteor
  suddenly ending your world is as real as can be. It could happen next year, or
  next month. And well, it could also happen tomorrow.<o:p>

  then there was another apocalyptic event, some 590 million years ago. One day,
  a meteorite of incredible proportions slammed hard into what's now South
  Australia, digging a crater about four kilometers deep and some 40 kilometers
  wide (currently known as Lake Acraman). Within seconds the whole thing
  vaporized into a huge firestorm. The impact was so devastating, it must have created
  massive earthquakes and 100-meter high tsunamis even hundreds of kilometers

  the scene of a similar event. A huge meteor went kaboom over Norway 150
  million years ago - speaking in geological terms, right before the Great
  Exterminator.
  The explosion slammed a 40-kilometer wide bump in the
  seabed of the Barents Sea, the so-called `Mjoelnir Crater'. Researchers still

  and even when humanity was around, the meteors kept hitting us.</font> For example,
  according to some researchers, the legendary floods of Deucalion, the Sumerian

  recent, in the year 1490 A.D., the city of Ch'ing Yang in Central China was
  the scene of a weird disaster. The event was recorded in at least ten ancient
  textbooks, all claiming that the event killed many thousands of people as it
  `rained stones and fire'. Likely cause: an asteroid as big as a modest sky
  scraper, going kaboom high up in the Earth's atmosphere.<o:p>

  June 30th of 1908, a loud explosion shook the village of Tunguska in
  Middle-Siberia. Local inhabitants saw a huge blast of fire in the sky. There
  was a sudden temperature rise, and a blazing forest fire, lighting up the
  horizon. No less than two thousand square miles of forest were devastated. As
  we know now, a twelve story building sized piece of rock hit the atmosphere
  over Siberia and exploded at a height of some eight kilometers. The energy
  set free at the event was equivalent to 15 megatons of TNT -- a thousand
  atomic bombs!<o:p>

  it's no pessimistic estimate that our planet can bounce into a freaky piece of
  space rock again. Cosmologists estimate an extinction type comet hits the

  course, the effect of a meteor impact depends on the place where it hits the
  Earth. The meteor that killed the dinosaurs, for example, hit a soil loaded
  with sulfuric rock, which enormously boosted the comet's devastating effect.
  Had it hit the planet several hundreds of miles westwards, it would have
  plunged into the ocean -- and the dinosaurs probably would have survived. On
  the other hand, if a Tunguska-type meteor happens to </span></font></span><span lang="EN-US" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"><font face="MS Sans Serif">hit an inhabited area, it will definitely wipe
  it off the face of the Earth entirely. Considering that&nbsp; some 10 percent

  harsh fact is that such `protection' is far less reliable than Nasa wants us
  to believe. For example, in March 1998, a BIG comet nearly hit us. Remarkably,
  no one saw it coming. Because it came straight at us, the thing was only
  visible as a tiny speck in the sky, not as a distinct, moving object
  traversing the cosmos from left to right. Consequently, no one noticed it -- until it passed.</font></span></p>

  spot an ice comet when it comes so close to the Sun that it begins to melt.
  We'll recognize it by its tail by then. But according to many critical
  astronomers, this will be much too late to take any action.</font></span></p>
