referred to as the Panhandle, you will find the <br soft="">picturesque seaside town of Panama City. &nbsp;It is a scenic place of <br soft="">natural beauty populated with friendly folk who welcome all visitors <br soft="">as family. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stately, old, expansive Southern Plantation mansions <br soft="">greet you along palm and oak lined avenues. &nbsp;Widespread oaks of <br soft="">immense size and antiquity, their branches drooping nigh to earth <br soft="">and gently waving a courteous hello in the warm sea breeze. &nbsp;Leafy <br soft="">limp limbs adorned with silvery, curly strands of Spanish moss like <br soft="">Christmas trees decorated with tinsel or Southern Belles beckoning <br soft="">you with their lace handkerchiefs to stop in for a mint julep or a tall, <br soft="">cool glass of lemonade. &nbsp;Rows of green Azalea hedges bloom pink <br soft="">in the Spring and the soft blend of Gulf air with flower scent <br soft="">perfumes these charming byways with an intoxicating aroma that <br soft="">sooths away the ills of a weary traveler's soul. &nbsp;Gulls mewing and <br soft="">calling at the surf where the salty waves gently lap at white, sugar <br soft="">sands. &nbsp;Sand dollars and horseshoe crabs, rainbows and sunsets <br soft="">paint a pristine picture of nature at her finest in this lea of littoral <br soft="">delight. &nbsp;A sportfisherman's paradise some call it, for this entire <br soft="">coastal habitat is veined with bays, bayous, coves, inlets, creeks <br soft="">and branches of tiny, secluded watercourses. &nbsp;It is certainly a <br soft="">veritable nature lover's paradise. &nbsp;The brackish waters provide a <br soft="">diverse marine estuary which serves as a fundamental element in the <br soft="">food chain and thus, the ebb and flow of life. &nbsp;Aye, the great old <br soft="">mansions can be seen as you tour along lazy avenues like the one <br soft="">called Beach Drive which follows the genial, inviting coastline of <br soft="">Saint Andrew Bay. &nbsp;This is the modern day Panama City. &nbsp;However, <br soft="">during the time in which our story takes place, only one or two of <br soft="">those big, square, comfortable looking homes peered out over the <br soft="">Bay. &nbsp;You can spy the originals even today, for though they have <br soft="">been refurbished and maintained through succeeding generations, <br soft="">these archaic estates do show clues to their rustic old age. &nbsp;Panama <br soft="">City wasn't much more than a quaint country community sprouting <br soft="">on a sparkling shore during the era of our nautical chronicle. &nbsp;A few <br soft="">homesteaders working government land grants. &nbsp;Just to the East of <br soft="">this nostalgic maritime settlement, the land is densely wooded with <br soft="">long leaf pines on high sandy bluffs dropping off into twisted <br soft="">thickets of low growing branches and thorny vines in the mucky <br soft="">swamp bottoms and cypress heads. &nbsp;Within these marshy <br soft="">backwaters creep every buzzing, crawling, biting vermin to ever <br soft="">plague mortals on earth. &nbsp;Tarantula~like, gargantuan spiders with <br soft="">florescent yellow fur covering their long, searching legs spin <br soft="">cast~net sized webs which, when viewed in profile, glow with the <br soft="">same eerie bright yellow color. &nbsp;Venomous moccasins prowl the <br soft="">decomposing organic ground, silently slithering among fermenting <br soft="">brown twigs and leaves which are endlessly drifting out of the tight <br soft="">canopy downward to the uneven surface of the wetland floor. &nbsp;These <br soft="">thick, chunky serpents with their short, blunt tails are perfectly <br soft="">camouflaged to lie unseen among the rotting foliage. &nbsp;Only when <br soft="">spooked do they draw the eye of any intrepid explorer. &nbsp;Intrepid, <br soft="">indeed, is our explorer for naught but insatiable curiosity or the lust <br soft="">for buried treasure could force a person to hazard into this <br soft="">otherwise unseen otherworldly realm of shadow, dampness and <br soft="">danger. &nbsp;The water moccasins alone are enough to steer most folks <br soft="">clear of places like Sea~Hag Bog. &nbsp;Silent and invisible such <br soft="">creatures are until, when nearly stepped on, these slithery denizens <br soft="">of the morass and quagmire quickly dart for the water's edge, <br soft="">disappearing without a sound into the murky pools and winding <br soft="">sloughs to again disguise themselves among the same twigs and <br soft="">leaves which also litter the muddy channels. &nbsp;The pungent marsh <br soft="">odor bubbles up, fumigating the branch and bramble atmosphere <br soft="">with byproduct gases of twig, leaf and other recyclables which lie <br soft="">water~logged, slowly decaying neath the surface of the deceptive <br soft="">tributaries which guard and hide the secret of their depths under a <br soft="">shimmering and cloudy veil of swirling sediment. &nbsp;The eye of our <br soft="">adventurer follows the hypnotic sway of a winding wig of Spanish <br soft="">moss down from the sagging limb of a water~oak, opening lids wide <br soft="">as it comes to rest upon a fat, heavy, fallen cypress tree. &nbsp;An old, <br soft="">gray, algae covered log large enough to carve into a dugout canoe. &nbsp;<br soft="">Wait a minute. &nbsp;Logs don't have eyes !! &nbsp;That's no log !! It's an <br soft="">Alligator !! &nbsp;Back up slowly now. &nbsp;One step at the time. &nbsp;Don't take <br soft="">your eyes off of the hideous thing. &nbsp;Can it sense fear ?? &nbsp;Aye, the <br soft="">swamps and backwaters of the Florida Panhandle are numerously <br soft="">inhabited by these leather~skinned leviathans. &nbsp;Dinosaurs with <br soft="">giant, tooth filled jaws which can bite a boat in half !! &nbsp;The <br soft="">Intracoastal Waterway cuts right through the bowels of this <br soft="">inhospitable region and in a certain spot along the Intracoastal <br soft="">Canal, close to the mouth of Wetappo Creek and about a mile <br soft="">Southeast of Ringjaw Camp within sight of Lookout Point, there's a <br soft="">treacherous bend known as Devil's Elbow. &nbsp;It is here that a <br soft="">remarkable fortune in Spanish Gold Bullion lies hidden, buried in a <br soft="">secret location by a Confederate Pirate, or Privateer as he preferred <br soft="">to be called, during the waning days of the Civil War. &nbsp;Hubert <br soft="">Scribbner by name, but everyone called him Scribb for short. &nbsp;He <br soft="">was short, too. &nbsp;Measuring in at only 5 feet 5 and a half inches, there <br soft="">were many womenfolk who were taller than he. &nbsp;Before the War <br soft="">broke out, Scribb worked for a cattle rancher named Courtney at the <br soft="">meager pay~rate of only a dollar a day and his lunch. &nbsp;It is recorded <br soft="">in some histories that Courtney Point on Saint Andrew Bay, which <br soft="">can be spotted on various nautical charts of the area, is named in <br soft="">honor of Ranch Boss Courtney. &nbsp;Back in those days, Panhandle <br soft="">cattle ranchers were called Florida Crackers on account of the <br soft="">bullwhips they cracked in herding their beef cattle from pasture to <br soft="">pasture among the pines and palmettos. &nbsp;When fattened, oft as <br soft="">many as ten thousand head, the cattle were then cracked on off to <br soft="">the regional livestock market at the Port of Apalachicola, mostly to <br soft="">show to foreign buyers and fetch top dollar. &nbsp;Scribb used to hear <br soft="">talk amongst the Florida Cattle Ranchers of how the Sloops, Brigs <br soft="">and Cutters which sailed up the Gulf Coast from Cuba bringing <br soft="">purchasing agents to the auctions were laden with Spanish Gold. &nbsp;<br soft="">Heavy bars of shiny gold; ingots of convenient size and shape, each <br soft="">one a Pirate's bounty. &nbsp;Enough to establish a man in respectable <br soft="">society for life. &nbsp;Nearly 100 percent pure and neatly stacked in iron <br soft="">clad wooden chests which had shapely, curved lids, likewise, of <br soft="">such heavy weight themselves that one must be careful with one's <br soft="">fingers when raising or lowering the massive chest lids. &nbsp;Oh, how <br soft="">Scribb's heart used to lurch in his chest every time he saw those <br soft="">fancy dressed Cuban purchasing agents in their silk shirts, suede <br soft="">boots and broad brimmed Cavalier hats trimmed with fluffy ostrich <br soft="">plumes !! &nbsp;He entertained many's the fantasy about what he would <br soft="">do if he could but lay his hands on just one of those Spanish Gold <br soft="">Bullion Bars !! &nbsp;No more saddle sores for him. &nbsp;He didn't mind so <br soft="">much being called a Cracker, after all it was a worthy title for a <br soft="">young man. &nbsp;It brought with it a certain air of command and respect, <br soft="">but he didn't like the back breaking labor of wrangling a living out of <br soft="">punchin' cows in the heat and humidity of the Florida Gulf Coast. &nbsp;<br soft="">He had always dreamed of a life at sea. &nbsp;He fantasized and waxed <br soft="">romantic about the adventures of sea voyages to far off exotic <br soft="">places like the Mediterranean, India and the islands of the South <br soft="">Pacific. &nbsp;Scribb was generally not very well liked as it was <br soft="">considered by all who knew anything of him that he had a <br soft="">persecution complex due to his lack of manly height and this, it was <br soft="">rumored, accounted for his defensive personality and quickness of <br soft="">temper. &nbsp;Scribb's tawny, scraggly hair flipped and flopped over his <br soft="">piercing green eyes. &nbsp;Being constantly at rigorous manual labor, <br soft="">Scribb maintained a trim, fit figure. &nbsp;In fact, he was rather robust and <br soft="">stalwart; solid as a bulkhead. &nbsp;His round, cropped head and his sun <br soft="">weathered face swept from side to side in perpetual glances in all <br soft="">directions as if he morbidly feared a sneak attack upon his person <br soft="">from any direction at any moment. &nbsp;His North European blood could <br soft="">not be concealed in his brawny veins, for he had the carriage and <br soft="">dress of a scrying Dutchman. &nbsp;Scribb gripped grog in watering holes <br soft="">up and down the coast but he never got tanked in taverns lest he <br soft="">bear the brunt of some rowdy reveler's joke. &nbsp;Scribb paid attention <br soft="">to all the idle gab and burly talk, keenly on his awares for any <br soft="">information which might be useful to him in his nefarious plots and <br soft="">plans to escape the clutches of poverty and hard work. &nbsp;It was, in <br soft="">fact, these very routine rural ramblings which made him hate being <br soft="">tied to the land day and night. &nbsp;He was determined to wrench <br soft="">himself free from his monotonous existence as a cattle hand and <br soft="">find his away aboard an outbound ship to make real his heart's <br soft="">desire of life on the Briny. &nbsp;Scribb had a profound longing for the <br soft="">sea. He desperately yearned for the exciting discovery and riches <br soft="">which he just knew awaited him among the uncharted waters of the <br soft="">high seas. &nbsp;He didn't want to be a land~lubber for the rest of his life <br soft="">and he had a chip on his shoulder about it which was the real <br soft="">reason Scribb didn't much associate himself with others. &nbsp;Being <br soft="">land~lubbin' scallywags themselves meant that they were beneath <br soft="">him in breed and character and therefore not worthy of his daring <br soft="">comradery. &nbsp;"I can navigate the Gulf of Mexico!" Scribb would say to <br soft="">himself of an evening.<br><br>And so it was that, in the summer of the memorable year 1867 from <br soft="">the back of his bay steed as he cracked the lumbering, browsing <br soft="">Herefords on to the next green pasture, Scribb peered out across the <br soft="">wide vista of Saint Andrew Bay at the old, abandoned Beacon Beach <br soft="">Lighthouse. &nbsp;The old lighthouse stood atop a massive sand dune on <br soft="">what is now Shell Island. &nbsp;During Scribb's era Shell Island wasn't an <br soft="">island at all, but a spur of the mainland. This slim strip of sand, <br soft="">sea~oats and scrub thickets of various indigenous species <br soft="">narrowed into a point at the Gulf's edge where a natural harbor <br soft="">entrance gave access to the Bay. &nbsp;The constantly shifting sandbar <br soft="">shoals made it shallow and dangerous for large vessels to navigate <br soft="">and hence its name, Shipwreck Narrows. &nbsp;It is still there today. &nbsp;With <br soft="">the construction of a jetty~lined deep water passage into the Bay <br soft="">some small distance to the west, this strip of white, sandy beach <br soft="">became cut off from the mainland thus forming an island which was, <br soft="">during the middle part of the 20th century, named Shell Island. &nbsp;The <br soft="">East Pass at Land's End, as the locals now call it, is seldom used by <br soft="">any but the smallest vessels. &nbsp;Shipwreck Narrows was then, as it is <br soft="">now, treacherous sailing and has claimed its toll of seaman and sea <br soft="">going craft alike. &nbsp;To the eastward of Shipwreck Narrows lie the <br soft="">brackish, sun drenched marshes of Crooked Island Sound. &nbsp;In <br soft="">Scribb's day, the old Beacon Beach Lighthouse perched atop its <br soft="">massive sand dune sat proudly overlooking the emerald green, <br soft="">sapphire blue waters of the Gulf of Mexico. &nbsp;It was accessed by a <br soft="">wagon trail which circumnavigated the Bay. &nbsp;Widow's Walk wagon <br soft="">trail, as it was then known, was dotted with little wooden bridges <br soft="">over the numerous creeks, bogs and tiny branches of bayous which <br soft="">crossed its path. &nbsp;Sturdy little hand crafted wooden crossings, any <br soft="">one of which provided a haven and source of inspiration for the <br soft="">poet, the painter and the storyteller alike. &nbsp;No one knew exactly how <br soft="">long the old Beacon Beach Lighthouse had shone its beam of light <br soft="">far out on to the Gulf guiding many a wayward seafarer to the safety <br soft="">of Saint Andrew Bay. &nbsp;All anyone knew for sure is that it was <br soft="">constructed by Spanish Colonists sometime during the late 18th <br soft="">century at the behest of their Spanish Ministry. &nbsp;The Spaniards used <br soft="">Haitian slaves as labor. &nbsp;At night these Caribbean slaves would light <br soft="">bonfires using driftwood. &nbsp;One account of this Creole activity is <br soft="">found in a letter from a missionary named Turnbull to the governor <br soft="">general of Pensacola dated 27 May 1789. &nbsp;Turnbull relates that the <br soft="">Spaniards watched from the safety of their Galleons at night as the <br soft="">slaves danced around huge fires to their native drum beats, much <br soft="">excited, running in and out of the Gulf surf, chanting incantations <br soft="">and performing mysterious ceremonies and rituals. &nbsp;This letter, <br soft="">combined with other sources, gave the old lighthouse a reputation <br soft="">for being haunted by exotic spirits as there can be little doubt that <br soft="">the strange rites performed by the slaves were of the religious <br soft="">practice known today as Voodoo and Santeria. &nbsp;Aye, the old Beacon <br soft="">Beach Lighthouse was reputed to be haunted and in time, as was <br soft="">prophesied by many who gossiped and rumored about the old <br soft="">lighthouse, this haunting manifested itself in grotesque and very <br soft="">real form. &nbsp;During the first years of the 1800's, two brothers named <br soft="">Malachiah and Jebediah Yorkson, Quakers from Salem, <br soft="">Massachusetts, came to operate and maintain the lighthouse for the <br soft="">Saint Andrew Bay settlement which immediately preceded the <br soft="">founding of Panama City. &nbsp;As the disquieting old legend recounts, a <br soft="">mighty and frightful hurricane, which had moved from the Caribbean <br soft="">into the Gulf late in the August of 1807, began to approach the <br soft="">northwest Florida Gulf Coast. &nbsp;The first signs appeared when the <br soft="">blue sky of the waning summer gained an unidentifiable and <br soft="">uncertain cast. &nbsp;High, streaked, elongated clouds with a clear <br soft="">metallic sheen began to assume the counter~clockwise motion <br soft="">familiar to hurricanes even when they are still some far distance out <br soft="">in the Gulf. &nbsp;By the second day, there were few, if any, places above <br soft="">head where even the smallest patch of opaque, milky sky could be <br soft="">seen. &nbsp;The scene above the lighthouse grew more ominous as <br soft="">morning passed into evening. &nbsp;Gigantic, dark storm clouds swollen <br soft="">with tropical rains hanging heavy in their low sagging bellies <br soft="">spiraled in faster~moving, tightening squall bands just over the top <br soft="">of the old lighthouse. &nbsp;Winds increased beyond gale force by <br soft="">nightfall and the swells following the rising storm surge were <br soft="">breaking with ever greater destructive power closer and closer to the <br soft="">high sand~dune which, along with a limestone foundation, formed <br soft="">the base of the old lighthouse. &nbsp;The two brothers had been warned <br soft="">by their fellow Bay villagers to abandon the old lighthouse for <br soft="">higher ground further inland, but being stubborn as the proverbial <br soft="">mule, they ignored the warnings of those more experienced with the <br soft="">Gulf weather and stayed with the old lighthouse. &nbsp;The brothers lived <br soft="">there. &nbsp;All they had in the world was in that old lighthouse. &nbsp;It was <br soft="">the only home and property which either of them had ever known <br soft="">outside of the orphanage in which they were raised. &nbsp;Sentimentally <br soft="">attached they were to the old lighthouse in spite of its reputation for <br soft="">being haunted by Voodoo spirits, but as the lightening ripped open <br soft="">the angry dome of dark clouds pressing down on their heads with <br soft="">the weight and full fury of the hurricane while thunder boomed in <br soft="">their very ears like the cannons of war, one can well imagine that the <br soft="">brothers were regretting their brash decision. &nbsp;By this late hour, it <br soft="">was too late to run. &nbsp;The storm surge, made higher still by the ill <br soft="">timed arrival of high tide, had completely surrounded the base of the <br soft="">lighthouse with crashing waves and fierce, swirling undertow. &nbsp;<br soft="">Death surrounded Malachiah and Jebediah on all sides, this it is <br soft="">well understood by all. &nbsp;No one, however, could have predicted the <br soft="">tragic, gruesome outcome resulting from this midnight, maritime <br soft="">storm of storms. &nbsp;For when this devastating Gulf cyclone made <br soft="">landfall on Saint Andrew Bay, its wrath, and perhaps the Voodoo <br soft="">which possessed the lighthouse with its taboo omen, set in motion <br soft="">a horrific chain of events which in all probability shall never be <br soft="">known to anyone save Malachiah and Jebediah Yorkson. &nbsp;By the <br soft="">next day, the tremendous tempest had rapidly moved inland several <br soft="">miles to the northeast, but the wretched sky still lay upon the Bay <br soft="">like a dark foreboding lid of oppression and the gale force winds <br soft="">were still tearing in off the Gulf with enough strength to knock a <br soft="">man down. &nbsp;It could be seen though, that amazingly enough, the old <br soft="">lighthouse was still there! &nbsp;It required another whole day and night <br soft="">for the winds to still and the sky to clear enough for anyone to <br soft="">safely traipse through the scattered seaweed, palm fronds, barrel <br soft="">staves, dead fish and other pulverized debris out to the old <br soft="">lighthouse to find out if Malachiah and Jebediah had survived the <br soft="">violent storm. &nbsp;A small company of male inhabitants from the all but <br soft="">totally leveled Saint Andrew Bay settlement approached the old <br soft="">lighthouse. &nbsp;On their way out, the rescuers couldn't help but notice <br soft="">a swirling funnel~shaped battery of gulls circling above the old <br soft="">Beacon Beach Lighthouse. &nbsp;As they made their way closer, they <br soft="">spotted vultures, turkey buzzards, a sure sign of death, morbidly <br soft="">hunched atop the old lighthouse. &nbsp;Crows, too, flapped and shuffled <br soft="">for position in the immediate vicinity. &nbsp;The entrance door was on the <br soft="">Gulf side and it wasn't until they reached this far side of the old <br soft="">lighthouse that they discovered the cause of the mass gathering of <br soft="">scavenger fowl. &nbsp;Nothing in their simple fishing farming lives could <br soft="">have prepared this humble little group of kind coastal folk for the <br soft="">macabre scene which met their unbelieving eyes. &nbsp;Seldom is such <br soft="">horror reflected upon the human countenance as was borne by the <br soft="">faces of each and every member of this small reconnaissance party <br soft="">on this day. &nbsp;The hurricane had left in its aftermath a most <br soft="">loathsome and ghastly sight. &nbsp;There, dangling in the sea~breeze, <br soft="">hanging high from the wrought iron banister of the old Beacon <br soft="">Beach Lighthouse, was the rigid lifeless body of Jebediah Yorkson. &nbsp;<br soft="">Tight around his abnormally elongated neck was jerked a <br soft="">hangman's noose of frayed hemp rope. &nbsp;Teddy Womack, the <br soft="">youngest of the search group, immediately fell into a convulsion of <br soft="">profuse vomiting and most of the others began to gag as if Teddy <br soft="">had set in motion a chain reaction of vile, putrid, involuntary bodily <br soft="">response. &nbsp;Everyone was speechless in the presence of this freakish <br soft="">death. &nbsp;Not a single word was said. &nbsp;There was no way that Jebediah <br soft="">could have been identified had he not been known as wearing the <br soft="">same red long~sleeve shirt all the time, for his face was bloated, <br soft="">distorted, discolored; his eyes both swollen shut. &nbsp;His hands too, <br soft="">protruding from his shirt cuffs, were swelled and of a most repulsive <br soft="">dark, bluish gray shade. &nbsp;The old lighthouse, though still standing, <br soft="">had sunk a foot or more into its foundation shifting so that it now <br soft="">leaned out toward the Gulf at such an angle as to cause one to <br soft="">wonder that it still balanced upright. &nbsp;It seemed to groan and grunt <br soft="">under its own weight promulgating the fear of it toppling over with <br soft="">convincing vehemence amid the perception of all. &nbsp;Wallace Grimsby, <br soft="">the self appointed leader of the troop, stepped up to the door with <br soft="">his eyes glancing up and down the tower ready to jump sidewise <br soft="">out of harm's way if it suddenly began to collapse. &nbsp;The macabre <br soft="">scene inside the old lighthouse which met his eyes as he shoved <br soft="">open the twisted, jammed door was as revolting and unspeakable as <br soft="">the repugnant spectacle outside. &nbsp;At the base of the stair~well with <br soft="">the blackened wooden steps spiraling above it was a small round <br soft="">table fashioned of local long leaf pine. &nbsp;Rough hewn and primitive in <br soft="">appearance, it served as both reading and dining table for the <br soft="">brothers. &nbsp;An oil lamp lay overturned in a puddle of foamy sea~water <br soft="">on the floor beside the simple table. &nbsp;Sprawled across the top of the <br soft="">table itself lay the ungainly corpse of Jebediah's brother Malachiah. &nbsp;<br soft="">His head was horribly injured. &nbsp;Chunks of skull, scalp and what <br soft="">appeared to be dried blood and brains were spattered upon the wall <br soft="">opposite the right side of his body. &nbsp;He was lying face down on the <br soft="">table as if he had been sitting for supper and simply dropped his <br soft="">upper body forward. &nbsp;His left hand lay flat open on the far side of the <br soft="">table from his face and loosely propped in his right was a flintlock <br soft="">English dueling pistol. &nbsp;Seeing Malachiah laying there devoid of life, <br soft="">all Wallace Grimsby could think about was the blue shirt which it <br soft="">was Malachiah's habit to wear and which he had on even in the <br soft="">stench of death. &nbsp;Without realizing what had come over him, Wallace <br soft="">entered unconsciously into a reverie about the strange custom the <br soft="">brother's had of Jebediah always in a red shirt and Malachiah <br soft="">always in a blue one. &nbsp;"Why had they done that?", he wondered. &nbsp;<br soft="">"What did it mean?" &nbsp;Just at that moment the old lighthouse let out <br soft="">a low, grinding sound, the vibration of which Wallace felt <br soft="">reverberating in his chest, and shifted further upon its base. &nbsp;<br soft="">Wallace snapped out of his trance, turned and ran from the <br soft="">threshold of the door while everyone else quickly took several steps <br soft="">back until they were well out of danger. &nbsp;Teddy managed on his <br soft="">hands and knees, still heaving bile from his intestines. &nbsp;Set rocking <br soft="">by the sudden movement of the tower, Jebediah's dead body swung <br soft="">round in wide circles and the foul odor of reeking, rotting flesh <br soft="">wafted over the group. &nbsp;That disgusting smell, the dreadful tragedy <br soft="">mixed with the heat, humidity and rancor of the silty surf caused by <br soft="">the upheaval of the rampaging hurricane was simply too much. &nbsp;The <br soft="">ragtag brigade just could not cope with it. &nbsp;Helping Teddy to his <br soft="">feet, they all walked off back to the rubble of their wrecked <br soft="">settlement. &nbsp;It was decided, sacrilegious as it seemed, that due to <br soft="">the instability of the old lighthouse the Yorkson brothers would be <br soft="">left where they were without attempting to retrieve them for proper <br soft="">burial. &nbsp;No sense losing other lives by trying for the interment of <br soft="">ones which were beyond saving.<br><br>~*~*~*~*~* Personal Log Entry ~*~*~*~*~*<br><br>Many of the noble citizens of our good settlement had their minds <br soft="">adversely affected to such a degree by the corpse of Jebediah <br soft="">Yorkson hanging and rotting in the sea~breeze at Beacon Beach <br soft="">Lighthouse that they were obliged to pull up stakes and relocate <br soft="">elsewhere. &nbsp;A good number of said being so malevolently sickened <br soft="">and disturbed that never again were they able to live upon any <br soft="">seacoast.<br>Wallace J. Grimsby<br>Saint Andrew Bay Township<br>13 September 1807<br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>Scribb didn't give a hoot about any odd history which the old <br soft="">lighthouse may have possessed. &nbsp;He didn't care if it was haunted or <br soft="">if a nightmarish, unspeakable atrocity had occurred there. &nbsp;He wasn't <br soft="">afraid of what may have happened in the past, his only concern was <br soft="">for the future. &nbsp;His future. &nbsp;Dark nights full of foul weather were the <br soft="">moments when Scribb felt most alive. &nbsp;He was energized by the <br soft="">mystery and the unknown passion of the elements. &nbsp;On a black and <br soft="">stormy night Scribb would make his way out to the old lighthouse <br soft="">by himself. &nbsp;No other could see what he could see, feel what he <br soft="">could feel nor fathom what he knew. &nbsp;In solitude he would push <br soft="">back the ramshackle door at the foot of the tilted old lighthouse and <br soft="">enter into its foreboding shadows. &nbsp;Flashes of lightening streaked <br soft="">through the musty gloom as he fumbled for the dark lantern which <br soft="">he kept hanging on a wooden peg just inside the door. &nbsp;Lighting the <br soft="">lantern and adjusting the shudder so that only a thin beam of whale <br soft="">oil light shown out in front of him, Scribb began his precarious <br soft="">ascent up the creaking wooden steps which wound around the inner <br soft="">wall in a clockwise fashion all the way to the top of the old <br soft="">lighthouse. &nbsp;As he climbed, he continuously darted cautious <br soft="">glances to his right as the safety railing had, over the aging years, <br soft="">fallen away in several places. &nbsp;The smell of heated metal joined with <br soft="">the stimulus of the stormy night to give him a sudden surge of <br soft="">excitement. &nbsp;The sea tempest howled away outside beating its way <br soft="">through the limestone walls of the old lighthouse with a muffled <br soft="">hum sounding like the wailing of a sick sea~calf. &nbsp;The pounding of <br soft="">the nearby surf rubbed tremors into the floor which resonated like a <br soft="">subterranean Voodoo drum in the hollow chamber of the old <br soft="">lighthouse. &nbsp;Adorned in a rain poncho, Scribb looked like a strange <br soft="">caricature of Jekyll &amp; Hyde rising like a phantom from the old <br soft="">lighthouse floor. &nbsp;The hemp rope strung corpse of Jebediah had <br soft="">long since vanished from outside and though the collapsed <br soft="">remnants of the old pine table lay in a heap on the floor, where was <br soft="">Malachiah's skeleton? &nbsp;There should have been a pile of rags and <br soft="">bones lying there with the broken down table. &nbsp;They didn't just get <br soft="">up and walk away by themselves. &nbsp;Or did they? &nbsp;As he slowly crept <br soft="">up the aged staircase he watched as long shadows stretched out <br soft="">ahead of him in anthropomorphic shapes shifting and flickering <br soft="">with the dim lantern light. &nbsp;"No one else will come near this crone's <br soft="">lair!", &nbsp;Scribb whispered to himself. &nbsp;"They probably think I'm crazy. &nbsp;<br soft="">Simple minded landlubbers!" &nbsp;He was snorting and chuckling with <br soft="">sinister delight. &nbsp;He marveled at the red bricks which lined the inner <br soft="">walls of the old lighthouse. &nbsp;Scribb knew these had been added by <br soft="">the Yorkson brothers and he wondered if the ghosts of Malachiah <br soft="">and Jebediah were watching him. &nbsp;He listened for the echo of their <br soft="">unfortunate souls and tried to imagine how a stormy night like this <br soft="">would have been with seawater washing in around the foundation. &nbsp;<br soft="">A creaking riser suddenly snapped with a loud pop and gave way <br soft="">under his right foot. &nbsp;In the blink of an eye Scribb's leg had shot <br soft="">through the rotting step up to his knee. &nbsp;With his left hand he <br soft="">instinctively grasped for a place to hold on to, scraping his knuckles <br soft="">against the coarse red bricks. &nbsp;Letting out an angry curse, he paused <br soft="">momentarily reflecting on how close he had just come to his own <br soft="">death. &nbsp;A fall from this height would break his neck for certain. &nbsp;<br soft="">Groping in the dark to pull himself back into a standing position, <br soft="">Scribb noticed that the brothers hadn't finished laying the red bricks <br soft="">all the way to the top. &nbsp;An exposed layer of rough, lumpy, hardened <br soft="">mortar on the last bed joint about two thirds of the way up the <br soft="">inside of the leaning tower showed where their work had stopped. &nbsp;<br soft="">Scribb had turned his hand at masonry, too; didn't like it at all. &nbsp;A <br soft="">life at sea was the only life for him. &nbsp;Reaching the top, he completely <br soft="">closed the shudder of his dark lantern, which he had somehow <br soft="">managed to hold onto during his accident, and placed it on the deck <br soft="">of the lamp room beside the cracked, tarnished fresnel lens. &nbsp;<br soft="">Carelessly shoving open the jagged, broken glass door at the <br soft="">glorious crest of the old Beacon Beach Lighthouse, Scribb stepped <br soft="">out onto the balcony. &nbsp;The full rapture of the thrashing winds in the <br soft="">midnight gale leaped upon him causing his skin to instantly rumple <br soft="">into gooseflesh. &nbsp;His weight and the swirling squall seemed to make <br soft="">the old lighthouse tremble and he jerked on the handrail and threw <br soft="">his head back as if daring the antique edifice to crumble over and <br soft="">bury him under stone, brick and rubble, crushing the very life out of <br soft="">him the way he would squash a palmetto bug with his boot. &nbsp;The <br soft="">middle of the night, the bewitching hour had arrived and the <br soft="">tempestuous energy of the wide open surging Gulf was at its fullest. <br soft="">&nbsp;Scribb had a powerful longing for the sea, true enough. &nbsp;It was his <br soft="">fate to plunder the wealth of the Gulf. &nbsp;It was his destiny to sail away <br soft="">from the uneventful world of the landsman and seek his fortune <br soft="">among the waves. &nbsp;Shaking his fists wildly high above the earth in <br soft="">the salty air with his face spattered in rain and squinting his passion <br soft="">filled, zealous green eyes straight into the angry gale Scribb <br soft="">shouted at the pitch of his lungs, "I am Neptune! &nbsp;I am Poseidon! &nbsp;I <br soft="">am Davy Jones!" &nbsp;It was at that moment that Scribb felt something <br soft="">which made him instantly shut his hollering mouth and stand rigid <br soft="">as a plank tightly gripping the banister railing. &nbsp;Someone, or some <br soft="">thing, had laid a hand on his shoulder. &nbsp;The hand had a heavy, firm <br soft="">grip but felt brutally hard, thin and sharp with spikes for finger nails <br soft="">which mercilessly dug into Scribb's flesh even through his poncho, <br soft="">vest and shirt. &nbsp;Slowly and with fear striking lines of horror in all his <br soft="">features, Scribb turned to face his assailant. &nbsp;Upon turning his head <br soft="">full round, Scribb's heart fell in his chest and his eyes widened in <br soft="">genuine fear for his immortal soul as he beheld the ghastly sight <br soft="">behind him. &nbsp;Flash after flash of bright yellow lightening illuminated <br soft="">the frenzied night with a beastly glow and there, staring Scribb right <br soft="">in his face, was the evil, spectral skeleton of Jebediah Yorkson !! &nbsp;&nbsp;<br soft="">Behind Jebediah, his brother Malachiah. &nbsp;Their red and blue shirts <br soft="">showing pale, bony rib cages through torn tatters. &nbsp;Their bare teeth <br soft="">menacing Scribb in an maniacal grin.<br><br><br><br></span></font></b><b><font color="#999900" size="6"><span style="font-size: 30px;

line-height: 29px;">Aye, Scribb wasn't interested in mixing with the local lot. &nbsp;That <br soft="">being what it was, about the only friend Scribb ever had was fellow <br soft="">ranch~hand named Tobber. &nbsp;Tobber had, as only the boss and a few <br soft="">others were aware, been convicted a number of years previous at <br soft="">Fort Walton of armed robbery involving a local merchant and his <br soft="">stash of rare Colonial Manuscripts made up of ledgers from <br soft="">pre~Revolutionary War tea~import accounts. &nbsp;These antique <br soft="">instruments of commerce, bearing origins mostly of Boston, Salem <br soft="">and Nantucket Island, were said to be of high value to and much <br soft="">desired by certain museums in England and on the European <br soft="">Continent. &nbsp;In those days, the city of Fort Walton was known as <br soft="">Camp Walton and Camp Walton wasn't officially formed and named <br soft="">until the start of the Civil War in 1861, but we shall get to that. &nbsp;The <br soft="">reason ranch boss Courtney had hired Jake Tobber, for that was his <br soft="">name, after his release from penal servitude is because he(Courtney) <br soft="">knew Jake's Aunt Louise. &nbsp;Being good friends with Aunt Louise <br soft="">naturally meant that Courtney believed the story she told of her <br soft="">nephew's innocence. &nbsp;According to Aunt Louise, the wealthy <br soft="">merchant was in love with a certain local debutante, Maria by name, <br soft="">whose innocent beauty remained unrivaled throughout the entirety <br soft="">of the Gulf Coast. &nbsp;The wealthy merchant's then employee and store <br soft="">manager, Jake, was the only thing, or so the merchant felt, that <br soft="">stood in his way of winning the lovely debutante's hand in marriage, <br soft="">as Jake and this hometown beauty had entered into friendly <br soft="">acquaintance with one another. &nbsp;The merchant, being not only <br soft="">wealthy but one of the founding fathers of the town which grew up <br soft="">around Camp Walton, surely had the advantage of reputation, <br soft="">integrity and believability in his favor. &nbsp;Whereas, Jake himself was a <br soft="">young man of no capital means as well as a new comer to the area; a <br soft="">stranger from outside. &nbsp;Jake's mother had died during childbirth and <br soft="">his father, being a military man stationed out West where there were <br soft="">still sporadic outbreaks of Indian attacks, felt that it would be a <br soft="">safer, healthier environment for his son, with more opportunities for <br soft="">a peaceable life, if he went to live with his Aunt Louise on the balmy <br soft="">Gulf Coast of Florida. &nbsp;<br soft=""></span></font></b></span></td>
