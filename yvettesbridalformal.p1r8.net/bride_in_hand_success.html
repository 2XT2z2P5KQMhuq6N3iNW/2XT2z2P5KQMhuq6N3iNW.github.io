&nbsp;The moaning. &nbsp;<br soft="">The wailing. &nbsp;Those guttural shrieks of dire fear. &nbsp;Mohana, a <br soft="">Hindu name which means "enchanting, bewitching". &nbsp;How <br soft="">mortifying. &nbsp;The whole nightmarish scenario. &nbsp;It reminded her <br soft="">of that hideous nursery rhyme. &nbsp;How did that loathsome <br soft="">lullaby go? &nbsp;(Hush little baby don't say a word, Daddy's gonna <br soft="">buy you a Mocking Bird, and if that Mocking Bird won't sing, <br soft="">Daddy's gonna buy you a diamond ring).<br>"The Mocking Bird didn't sing.", she mumbled to herself <br soft="">through dry, chapped lips as a tear found its way through the <br soft="">tiny slit of her trembling and closed eyelids. &nbsp;The tear would <br soft="">be salty, even in the dead of a still summer night, even if <br soft="">nobody tasted it. &nbsp;It would trickle down the side of her face, <br soft="">making its way into the tangled strands of her long, dark hair. &nbsp;<br soft="">Actually, her hair was light red. &nbsp;A strawberry blond they used <br soft="">to call her, but then, after it happened, she dyed her hair dark. &nbsp;<br soft="">First, purple in honor of her broken heart, then midnight black <br soft="">to match her perpetual mourning. &nbsp;The funeral was hers and <br soft="">the burial was today. &nbsp;Everyday. &nbsp;Mohana, the little strawberry <br soft="">blond princess died and was buried every day since that fatal <br soft="">night when she began to awaken to the horrid truth for the <br soft="">first time in her fairytale princess life. &nbsp;Her father had marched <br soft="">her down the aisle, so full of pride like a peacock strutting the <br soft="">glory of his plumage along side the royal train of her bridal <br soft="">gown. &nbsp;Her mother and her mother~in~law~to~be lighting the <br soft="">candles. &nbsp;The bridegroom, Brent Lawson, in a brown tuxedo <br soft="">with a pink vest and bow tie, waiting for her at the altar. &nbsp;A <br soft="">kiss, a bouquet, a honeymoon in the Caribbean. &nbsp;Then that <br soft="">night. &nbsp;That fateful night when she had prepared that special <br soft="">dinner for him, her husband, her new husband, the first and <br soft="">only husband that Mohana was to ever have. &nbsp;A special <br soft="">surprise dinner to celebrate their first night in their new home <br soft="">together. &nbsp;A big, white mansion, the loving wedding gift from <br soft="">her wealthy grandmother, complete with wrap around, <br soft="">colonnaded portico and gated white picket fence. &nbsp;Brent <br soft="">would be home from work soon. &nbsp;His first day at the Firm as a <br soft="">married man. &nbsp;She remembers that she had given face to a <br soft="">gentle smile at the thought of the congratulations, and, no <br soft="">doubt, some sporty heckling from his bachelor partners that <br soft="">Brent would have received that day. &nbsp;All in good fun. &nbsp;She <br soft="">would be informed of all the gossip because her best <br soft="">girl~friend and Maid of Honor, Kate Lebowitz, was receptionist <br soft="">at the Firm. &nbsp;Kate would tell her everything that happened at <br soft="">the offices that day. &nbsp;Then the first call came in. &nbsp;It was Brent's <br soft="">voice, "I'll be a little late, angel, one of our client's from <br soft="">Pensacola has brought an addendum over. &nbsp;We're gonna <br soft="">cover it in preliminary this evening. &nbsp;Shouldn't be more than <br soft="">an hour though, so I'll see you by eight, nine at the latest." &nbsp;A <br soft="">quick "I love you, bye." and the phone line clicked dead. &nbsp;<br soft="">Angel. &nbsp;At the memory of this, she tried to laugh but a cough, <br soft="">similar to a gag, got in the way and another tear trailed its way <br soft="">to her hairline. &nbsp;He always called her angel. &nbsp;That was one of <br soft="">his natural charms. &nbsp;He was irresistible in that way. &nbsp;In so <br soft="">many ways when she fell in love with him. &nbsp;That night she had <br soft="">tried not to get upset. &nbsp;After all, it was a surprise celebration <br soft="">dinner. &nbsp;Brent had no way of knowing that she had made his <br soft="">favorite dish, chicken cordon blue, for his first supper in their <br soft="">new home together. &nbsp;"Oh well", she thought, "work comes <br soft="">before play." &nbsp;The salads would be alright in the fridge and <br soft="">she could place the entree` in the oven to stay warm until he <br soft="">got home, to his new home with her. &nbsp;Brent was fortunate to <br soft="">have such a perfect start to his career. &nbsp;He worked hard at <br soft="">University and had graduated summa cum laude, first in his <br soft="">class, from the Florida State College of Engineering, <br soft="">continuing for another year and a half to earn his Master's. &nbsp;<br soft="">This and the strings her father had pulled on his behalf landed <br soft="">him a lucrative position with the most prestigious civil <br soft="">engineering firm in Panama City. &nbsp;Brent's brother, Brandon, an <br soft="">import dealer at a local lot, helped him make a down payment <br soft="">on his dream car, a Jaguar XJ8. &nbsp;Mohana was happy for her <br soft="">successful husband Brent. &nbsp;She would blow out the candles <br soft="">for now and sit at her end of the table admiring the china, the <br soft="">crystal, the silver and the flowers she had gathered from the <br soft="">garden and placed in a nineteenth century porcelain vase as a <br soft="">centerpiece. &nbsp;Such romantic place settings just for two and <br soft="">how many newlyweds had a pure white silk table cloth? &nbsp;She <br soft="">had even chilled a bottle of Dom. &nbsp;Mohana smiled again as she <br soft="">recalled the fun she had at their wedding teaching Brent to <br soft="">hold a champagne glass by its stem to insure the champagne <br soft="">wasn't being warmed by an all embracing hand. &nbsp;How <br soft="">delightful their first night in their new home as husband and <br soft="">wife was going to be in spite of Brent having to work late. &nbsp;<br soft="">Mohana had entered into a sweet reverie imagining how she <br soft="">would make love to Brent that night, the soft satin sheets <br soft="">luxuriously surrounding them in their super~soft king size <br soft="">bed. &nbsp;Mohana had gotten excited, anticipating marital bliss, <br soft="">but then the second call of that fateful night came in, the one <br soft="">with a Florida Highway Patrolman on the other end of the line. <br soft="">&nbsp;Oh, they were gonna be ok, the man and the woman in the <br soft="">XJ8 who had been in the auto accident, fender bender really, <br soft="">at the Blue Lagoon motel involving an SUV driven by a retiree <br soft="">from out of town. &nbsp;The retiree and his wife hadn't sustained <br soft="">any injuries, but the couple in the Jag had. &nbsp;Those airbags <br soft="">really blast out of there, you know. &nbsp;A short ambulance ride to <br soft="">the hospital is all that would be required for the two of them. &nbsp;<br soft="">Just to make sure their injuries were only minor. &nbsp;<br>"Couple?" Mohana asked the patrolman, "Man and woman? &nbsp;<br soft="">The two of them?"<br>The patrolman spoke in a cold, matter~of~fact voice and <br soft="">Mohana could visualize him referencing his written report <br soft="">"Yes, your husband and his passenger, a miss Lebowitz." was <br soft="">the toneless answer.<br>Without thinking, Mohana quickly shouted back into the <br soft="">phone receiver, "Kate Lebowitz?"<br>"Yes ma'am, a miss Kate Lebowitz. &nbsp;I've got a lot of work to do, <br soft="">ma'am, so I'm gonna have to let you go. &nbsp;If you would like to <br soft="">see your husband, they are taking them to Bay Medical Center <br soft="">downtown."<br>"A~a~alright officer, th~thank you." Her voice was shaking, <br soft="">trilling like a Mocking Bird in the morning. &nbsp;Unconscious of <br soft="">what she was doing, Mohana held her engagement ring up to <br soft="">the light to see if it was shining. &nbsp;Still holding her ring finger <br soft="">toward the light with eyes wide and rambling, she had to make <br soft="">three attempts in order to hook the telephone handset back <br soft="">into the charger on the kitchen counter. &nbsp;Like fire~hot, searing, <br soft="">molten lava the meaning of the patrolman's call began to <br soft="">become clear to her, boiling her skin from underneath and <br soft="">making spots appear before her eyes. &nbsp;She staggered back <br soft="">into the formal dining room, bracing herself against the <br soft="">mahogany dining table which she had spent the entire <br soft="">afternoon setting for the romantic celebration dinner that her <br soft="">and her new husband were to have shared together during <br soft="">their first night in their new home. &nbsp;She dropped to the shiny, <br soft="">wood floor hard on her hind quarter, haplessly dragging the <br soft="">silken tablecloth and the ornate place settings off the table. &nbsp;<br soft="">Those dainty dishes came crashing down with her, shattering <br soft="">into a hundred thousand pieces and shards all around her. &nbsp;<br soft="">The flower vase tumbled, bounced and broke, water running <br soft="">across the flat floor as if poured from a mop bucket. &nbsp;In such a <br soft="">state of shock was she that she didn't even feel it as the point <br soft="">of a serrated knife nicked the back of her hand causing a <br soft="">bright blot of crimson blood to drip down over her fingers, <br soft="">staining the pure white of the silken tablecloth with its <br soft="">unheeded flow. &nbsp;Mohana began to feel sick. &nbsp;She began to feel <br soft="">violently nauseous, as if she would heave her very intestines <br soft="">out into her lap. &nbsp;Gripping the silk with both hands she <br soft="">wadded it in fistfuls. &nbsp;Drawing a section taut, she placed it <br soft="">between her teeth. &nbsp;Tightly she pulled the cloth straight down <br soft="">on either side of her mouth, biting viciously into the fabric <br soft="">and staring blankly with wild, bulging eyes through the clear <br soft="">glass of the French doors that led out onto the patio. &nbsp;<br soft="">Mohana's whole body began to quiver. &nbsp;Darkness lay beyond <br soft="">those French doors. &nbsp;A hideous darkness full of treachery and <br soft="">deceit. &nbsp;She felt a scream begin to well up from deep inside <br soft="">her. &nbsp;Convulsing with anger, confusion and fear she howled <br soft="">shrill cry after shrill cry out of a mouth twitching with writhing <br soft="">internal pain. &nbsp;Her shrieks of emotional desecration echoed <br soft="">through the empty house with a haunting helplessness which <br soft="">told the sullen and shabby tale of a virgin broken heart. &nbsp;<br soft="">Trembling in solitary horror she began to remember her <br soft="">childhood playhouse. &nbsp;Those boiled, skinless new potatoes <br soft="">covered in black pepper. &nbsp;The red, beeswax candles. &nbsp;The <br soft="">chants. &nbsp;The scrolls hidden in the secret chest. &nbsp;The mystical <br soft="">etchings burnt into the pinewood walls. &nbsp;She knew Magic. &nbsp;<br soft="">She knew Wicca. &nbsp;She knew Witchcraft. &nbsp;Mohana the <br soft="">enchanting. &nbsp;Mohana the bewitching. &nbsp;Now the real horror <br soft="">would begin.<br soft=""></span></font></b></span></td>

Girl ~*~*~*<br><br></span></font></b><b><font color="#cc99ff" size="5"><span style="font-size: 24px; line-height: 29px;">It was a perfect day. &nbsp;The sun was shining, the sky was a <br soft="">thoughtful cerulean and a few small, puffy clouds drifted <br soft="">aimlessly across the blue vista like snow white cotton candy <br soft="">floating in the afternoon breeze. &nbsp;The babysitter, a remarkably <br soft="">beautiful, effeminate adolescent, with creamy skin, long raven <br soft="">hair, dark gypsy eyes and carrying a rainbow backpack over <br soft="">one shoulder, pulled a little red wagon. &nbsp;Riding happily along <br soft="">in the Radio Flyer was a pretty little girl, equally fair skinned <br soft="">named Mohana Voorloche. &nbsp;The little girl, blessed with the <br soft="">cutest strawberry blond curls of ultra~fine hair which flitted <br soft="">about her tiny shoulders, had just celebrated her third birthday <br soft="">and her amazing and most favorite birthday present was the <br soft="">little red wagon which now carried her down the edge of the <br soft="">street by the power of her babysitter's pull. &nbsp;A huge, long <br soft="">charcoal gray sedan with a low murmuring engine and tinted <br soft="">windows slowly drove by. &nbsp;The babysitter, Trudy Mars, was <br soft="">sweet sixteen and a distant relative who lived with her mother <br soft="">and older sister, Jan, five houses down Trinity Street from <br soft="">Mohana. &nbsp;Trudy's father had died from cancer eating away at <br soft="">his lungs at the young age of fifty, but Mohana's mother and <br soft="">father were both alive and well. &nbsp;As the babysitter pulled the <br soft="">handle of the little red wagon rolling it and its happy <br soft="">passenger down the edge of Trinity Street past the colorful <br soft="">mailboxes, some of them encased in brick fortresses, Mohana <br soft="">sang a happy song of her own composition. &nbsp;A frolicking <br soft="">melody kept in rhythm by the sound of loose gravel from the <br soft="">asphalt pavement grinding and popping under the black, <br soft="">plastic wagon wheels. &nbsp;White rims capped with a red hub <br soft="">cover reminiscent of an ice cream with a cherry on top. &nbsp;The <br soft="">wagon rolled up the Voorloche family driveway. &nbsp;There was a <br soft="">pause in Mohana's serenade as the babysitter stopped to <br soft="">unlatch the gate of the wooden privacy fence. &nbsp;Gently she <br soft="">pulled the little red wagon through, closing the gate after. &nbsp;<br soft="">When the babysitter resumed travel pulling the little red wagon <br soft="">through the back yard, Mohana's toddling voice again sang <br soft="">out her unintelligible lyrics. &nbsp;Mohana sang in a language all <br soft="">her own, as very young children often do. &nbsp;The babysitter <br soft="">understood the child's song. &nbsp;With a knowing smile on her <br soft="">face, the babysitter clearly deciphered the little girl's limerick. &nbsp;<br soft="">The well built playhouse sat in the farthest corner of the <br soft="">Voorloche backyard. &nbsp;It was a picturesque miniature of one of <br soft="">those nostalgic cha</span></font></b><b><font color="#cc99ff" size="5"><span style="font-size: 24px; line-height: 29px;">let</span></font></b><b><font color="#cc99ff" size="5"><span style="font-size: 24px; line-height: 29px;">s found in the Swiss Alps and was <br soft="">constructed of long leaf pine. &nbsp;A noble wood of character and <br soft="">distinction. &nbsp;An ancient wood imbued with esoteric <br soft="">connotations fit for any ritualistic purposes. &nbsp;The playhouse <br soft="">emitted the magic of the pine. &nbsp;The babysitter could feel its <br soft="">warm glow as they approached. &nbsp;Bouncing on her blanket as <br soft="">the little red wagon bumped over the clumps of green grass, <br soft="">the little girl also sensed the power of the playhouse and she <br soft="">began to sing louder, with more feeling.<br>The babysitter parked the little red wagon in front of the toy <br soft="">porch which fronted the dainty pine playhouse, turned to <br soft="">Mohana and admired her momentarily as the little girl sang her <br soft="">secretive song. &nbsp;The little girl continued singing as the <br soft="">babysitter bent over and lovingly lifted the red haired canary <br soft="">and her blanket from the Radio Flyer. &nbsp;Placing the precious <br soft="">melodic cargo on the playhouse front porch, the babysitter <br soft="">opened the playhouse door and entered. &nbsp;Mohana followed in <br soft="">full chorus. &nbsp;The window mounted air conditioner was then <br soft="">switched on, for pleasant as the atmosphere of Northwest <br soft="">Florida is in April, an enclosed chamber can become quite <br soft="">stuffy and warm. &nbsp;The stick of cinnamon hanging in front of <br soft="">the air conditioner vents began to gyrate and its pleasant <br soft="">aroma filled the magical playhouse. &nbsp;Letting her backpack <br soft="">slide gracefully from over her shoulder, Trudy the babysitter <br soft="">unzipped the rainbow pouch and began placing its contents <br soft="">on the playhouse tea~party table. &nbsp;Mohana, still warbling her <br soft="">mystical melody, had taken her seat at the tea~party table <br soft="">opposite Trudy. &nbsp;The babysitter removed from the rainbow <br soft="">backpack a Ouija Board, an old vellum scroll, five red beeswax <br soft="">candles, a lock of someone's hair, a festoon of spider's web <br soft="">wrapped around a Q~tip, 3 dried rose petals, a narrow <br soft="">Tupperware container filled with boiled, skinless <br soft="">new~potatoes completely covered in black pepper and a <br soft="">thermos of chilled cherry~red Kool~aid. &nbsp;Trudy poured a <br soft="">plastic teacup adorned in teeny floral motifs full of the <br soft="">cherry~red Kool~aid for Mohana and aristocratically passed it <br soft="">to the little girl who now ceased her song to taste her "tea". &nbsp;<br soft="">The little girl took the teacup with both hands and stared into <br soft="">the bright, red liquid. &nbsp;Trudy then unrolled the old vellum <br soft="">scroll and placed it on the tea~table keeping it open by placing <br soft="">a fist sized stone on each of its four corners. &nbsp;The vellum was <br soft="">inscribed with Crescent Moons, Ankhs, Pentagrams and other <br soft="">arcane symbolism of the Occult. &nbsp;Trudy continued <br soft="">ceremoniously placing the Pagan ritualistic implements in <br soft="">precise magical arrangement around the tea~table, talking to <br soft="">Mohana while she did so.<br>"You will see, my dear little Mohana, as you grow, that most <br soft="">people are brainwashed by the so~called scriptures and other <br soft="">mass media to fight amongst themselves all the time. &nbsp;They are <br soft="">unwittingly induced into violent and unproductive behavioral <br soft="">patterns by a theater of melodrama in the guise of Good <br soft="">versus Evil. &nbsp;For example, many in our part of the world are <br soft="">conned by such slogans as join the Army of God in the Fight <br soft="">Against Evil. &nbsp;In this way, they are tricked into a constant state <br soft="">of fear and bellicosity. &nbsp;So continuously are they encouraged <br soft="">to make war until peaceful living becomes foreign to them. &nbsp;<br soft="">Make war against what? &nbsp;The threat against their person is a <br soft="">veiled and unqualified threat indeed. &nbsp;The very word <br soft="">"scripture" is a euphemism which is used to give the illusion <br soft="">of credibility to Biblical propaganda. &nbsp;In this way, peace has <br soft="">become such a strange and unfamiliar concept that people <br soft="">don't know what to do with it. &nbsp;Peace makes them feel <br soft="">uncomfortable. &nbsp;They are conditioned like Pavlov's Dog. &nbsp;Only, <br soft="">instead of being conditioned to salivate when a bell rings, <br soft="">people are conditioned into the habit of fighting all the time. &nbsp;<br soft="">What they don't realize is that there's nothing against which to <br soft="">fight. &nbsp;There is no Army of God and there is no Fight Against <br soft="">Evil. &nbsp;They are shadow boxing. &nbsp;They are zealots to their own <br soft="">demise. &nbsp;Their fanaticism is self defeating. &nbsp;Round and round <br soft="">they go, battling a nonexistent opponent, troubling <br soft="">themselves over nothing from cradle to grave. &nbsp;Wasting their <br soft="">life force. &nbsp;Dissipating their magical energies instead of <br soft="">achieving harmony with the cosmos so that they may ascend <br soft="">to a better life. &nbsp;The wealthy elite are vampires, bloodsuckers <br soft="">feeding off the life force of commoners, beguiling the working <br soft="">class with the effervescent sparkle of Capitalism. &nbsp;Charming <br soft="">the regular folk with promises of wealth world without end, <br soft="">luring them to tilt back their heads and lay open their soft <br soft="">throats to the sharp, hungry fangs of the Captains of Industry."<br><br>During the babysitter's expounding, Mohana sat quietly <br soft="">sipping her Kool~aid, mildly amused and very attentive to <br soft="">every word. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But then again," Trudy continued, "the commoners are <br soft="">vampires themselves. &nbsp;Cannibals, really. &nbsp;Feeding off of each <br soft="">other's greed. &nbsp;Don't they realize that they themselves kill each <br soft="">other for no just reason? &nbsp;They also slaughter other living <br soft="">creatures for food. &nbsp;They kill rabbits, deer, cows, sheep, goats, <br soft="">chickens. &nbsp;People kill living, breathing organisms and devour <br soft="">their bloody flesh. &nbsp;People are the Devil. &nbsp;People are monsters. &nbsp;<br soft="">If they want to see Evil, real Evil, all they have to do is look in <br soft="">the mirror. &nbsp;In other religious cults, Buddhism for example, the <br soft="">followers simply sit down and do nothing. &nbsp;Peace isn't lack of <br soft="">forward motion. &nbsp;Peace is progress. &nbsp;Peace is progress without <br soft="">violence and without needless, wasteful sacrifice of life. &nbsp;<br soft="">Mohana, my dear, you have been born into a world of <br soft="">barbarians and zombies. &nbsp;You are a witch, a sorceress, a child <br soft="">of nature, and nature, my precious Mohana, is a process of <br soft="">becoming. &nbsp;One cannot become if one destroys oneself in <br soft="">fruitless conflict. &nbsp;One cannot become if one meditates ones <br soft="">self into nothingness. &nbsp;That birthmark behind your left ear, the <br soft="">raven~shadow. &nbsp;You are a true possessor of Witchcraft, <br soft="">Mohana my love, and I shall help guide you toward greater <br soft="">command of your Witchcraft."<br>The little girl burped and nodded her head in acquiescence. &nbsp;<br soft="">The birthmark behind her left ear began to grow warm. &nbsp;A <br soft="">green aura surrounded her tender neck and the raven~shadow <br soft="">moved its wings.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You understand the words I am saying to you at the <br soft="">intuitive level now, Mohana. &nbsp;Like an instinct, you know what I <br soft="">am telling you. &nbsp;When you are older, my words will rise from <br soft="">your subconscious mind and you shall know them in the clear <br soft="">light of day and they will help you discover other truths which <br soft="">will carry you through the dark shadows of night. &nbsp;Good and <br soft="">Evil are like matter, they are neither created nor destroyed. &nbsp;<br soft="">You can, however, manipulate both Good and Evil to your <br soft="">advantage. &nbsp;Yes, my little Mohana, I shall teach you all that I <br soft="">know and as you grow, you shall find out greater truths, <br soft="">stronger Magic. &nbsp;You are a natural witch, Mohana. &nbsp;Ones like <br soft="">you come along once every seventh generation. &nbsp;On occasion <br soft="">a child will inherit the Craft directly from a parent, it may fall to <br soft="">a grandchild or a niece or nephew, but this is rare. &nbsp;Your <br soft="">surname, Voorloche, is the ancient Scandinavian word for <br soft="">Warlock and Mohana is a Hindu name which

Earth. &nbsp;Taught to her were the powers of the <br soft="">elementals and the rudimentary precepts of the spell, the hex <br soft="">and the incantation. &nbsp;Seances, channeling, divination; the <br soft="">proper magical steps for making candles, besoms and corn <br soft="">dollies. &nbsp;Mohana was given her first Scrying mirror. &nbsp;Trudy the <br soft="">babysitter read to Mohana the young, natural Witch from <br soft="">Malleus Maleficarum, the Witches Hammer, so that Mohana <br soft="">would be armed with the knowledge of how to cleverly evade <br soft="">detection thereby avoiding persecution and possible <br soft="">prosecution for practising Witchcraft. &nbsp;Mohana heard of the <br soft="">horrors of Witch hunts. &nbsp;She listened to verbatim transcripts of <br soft="">the legal documents from the Salem Witch Trials of 1692, <br soft="">which inculcated within her an instinctive mistrust for those <br soft="">hypocritical bigots who despise the wielders of magic. &nbsp;The <br soft="">bigots don't understand magic, Mohana learned, and they fear <br soft="">what they don't understand. Fear leads to suspicion; <br soft="">suspicion to hatred and hatred to violence. &nbsp;All magic and the <br soft="">ancient ways of the Witch were revealed to Mohana and she <br soft="">excelled in her studies. &nbsp;Conjuring spirits and obtaining <br soft="">information from ghosts became one of Mohana's favorite <br soft="">games. &nbsp;Day and night the beeswax candles burned. &nbsp;Day and <br soft="">night the young Witch Mohana learned. &nbsp;As the days turned to <br soft="">weeks, the weeks to months and the months to years, no adult <br soft="">would have ever guessed or believed what cryptic dark Masses <br soft="">took place in that well constructed, magical pine playhouse in <br soft="">a normal backyard in the heart of Suburbia.<br soft=""></span></font></b></span></td>
