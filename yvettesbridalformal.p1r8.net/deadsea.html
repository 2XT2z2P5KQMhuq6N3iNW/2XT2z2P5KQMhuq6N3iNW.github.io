29px;">one time, when I was a little yungan, I had walked out into the <br soft="">woods behind our house ..................it got dark before I could <br soft="">find my way back .................I was only about 7 years old and <br soft="">those woods were real swampy and spooky lookin' even in the <br soft="">light of day, I can't describe what it was like to be out there at <br soft="">night........horror is to</span></font></b><b><font color="#ffff33" size="5"><span style="font-size: 24px; line-height: 29px;">o</span></font></b><b><font color="#ffff33" size="5"><span style="font-size: 24px; line-height: 29px;"> soft a word.........well, I had just about <br soft="">given up on finding my way out of that hateful forsaken place <br soft="">and I was getting ready to start screaming my head off in the <br soft="">hope that somebody would hear me and run out into the swamp <br soft="">woods to rescue me, but as I took a deep breath to start <br soft="">screaming I heard something walking thru the thick underbrush <br soft="">and I also saw a faint glow.......like a candle light or some such <br soft="">thing.............the sound and the light were out in front of me a <br soft="">little ways and seemed to be moving my direction.............it <br soft="">goes without saying that I quick shut my mouth and got real <br soft="">still and quiet..........I was frozen with fear............I half wished it <br soft="">was someone familiar who was gonna help me, but I also half <br soft="">feared some unseen, unimaginably gruesome and hairy and <br soft="">toothy thing with claws like razor blades and hungry angry red <br soft="">burning eyes was going to get me...............as the light got <br soft="">brighter and the sound got louder I could tell that it was more <br soft="">than one something moving towards me..............it sounded like <br soft="">several feet stomping through the dead branches and leaves <br soft="">and pine straw and tearing through vines and stuff...........and <br soft="">then I could hear voices too..............I could hear what sounded <br soft="">like echoes of smooth, silky voices and they seemed to be <br soft="">chattering ferociously amongst themselves and laughing about <br soft="">whatever it was they were saying..........then, as I was standing <br soft="">there shaking so hard I felt like I was gonna rattle apart, with my <br soft="">poor feet frozen to that one spot on the ground, I saw the first <br soft="">one of 'em.........my eyes were so wide open till my eyeballs <br soft="">scraped with the dryness of not blinking and in the cool night <br soft="">air the stinging sensation was intensified but my eyes just <br soft="">wouldn't water and I couldn't close them, not even for a split <br soft="">second........ my feet felt like they were made of lead and they <br soft="">started to sting too like they were falling asleep..........it began to <br soft="">feel as though I wasn't getting any blood circulation to my <br soft="">feet..............my heart was beatin' like a jackhammer and it felt <br soft="">like it was driving my lungs right out through my <br soft="">ribcage..........and as this first one passed by right in front of <br soft="">me, he looked over at me.............I was a little kid and this dude <br soft="">was lookin' straight ahead right into my face.........he was no <br soft="">taller than I ............ he grinned at me as he passed and kind of <br soft="">held his lantern up and towards me a little bit as if he wanted to <br soft="">get a better look at me, but he didn't stop, he just kept on <br soft="">walking...........then right behind him another one was walking, <br soft="">but he didn't have a lantern...........and another one right behind <br soft="">that one had a lantern and so on in that order...............I don't <br soft="">know how many of them there were...........I was too freaked to <br soft="">count........counting was the last thing on my mind at that <br soft="">point..........in fact, at that point, I didn't even have a mind........I <br soft="">was in shock and terrified out of my wits .........but one right <br soft="">after another they walked on by right in front of me and each <br soft="">and every one of them looked at me and grinned..........they just <br soft="">kept on walking and kept on talking about whatever it was that <br soft="">had 'em jabberin' so.........what a clatter...........it sounded like <br soft="">one of 'em had the hiccups ............I couldn't understand a <br soft="">single word they were saying..........it all jumbled together like <br soft="">so much jibberish and meant nothing to me anyway I could <br soft="">figure it, if I could have figured ..........and anyway, my ears were <br soft="">ringing so loud till even if they had been speakin' English I <br soft="">wouldn't have known what they were saying...........they may <br soft="">have been speaking English for all I know, but it didn't sound <br soft="">like any language I had ever heard and that infernal ringing was <br soft="">all I could really hear..........they were all dressed exactly the <br soft="">same.............they looked similar to the way Hollywood movies <br soft="">show pirates, but not exactly like that...........and every single <br soft="">one of them had what looked like a yellow/green bib hanging <br soft="">around his neck..........and black boots that went up to their <br soft="">knees..........the lanterns they had weren't like any lantern I had <br soft="">ever seen.............they held their hands like they were holding <br soft="">onto a handle, but I didn't see a handle...........not one handle on <br soft="">any of the lanterns...........and the light of the lanterns changed <br soft="">color and shape.........every color of the rainbow and then <br soft="">some..........the lantern lights looked like a bunch of mixed up <br soft="">figure 8's.........and there was this smell................I had never <br soft="">smelled that smell before and it wasn't until I was in Canada <br soft="">about 6 years ago that I finally learned what that smell <br soft="">was...........when I was on my last visit to Canada this gal up <br soft="">yonder served me a steaming hot cup of Camomile <br soft="">tea............and I dang near dropped the cup when she handed it <br soft="">to me, because right as she handed me the cup, the first waft of <br soft="">the scent of the tea hit my nostrils..............needless to say, I <br soft="">was ready to get back home to Florida when that happened, <br soft="">because no matter where I went or what I did after that day, I <br soft="">couldn't get the teasing fragrance of that Camomile tea out of <br soft="">my nose.............it seemed like everything smelled like the smell <br soft="">of those spooky lookin' little dudes I had seen that night when I <br soft="">was a kid in the swamp woods all by myself..............well, <br soft="">finally, after this long line of strange lookin' little dudes had <br soft="">passed right in front of me at almost arms length, the last one <br soft="">in the line walked past.........and as he passed in front of me, he <br soft="">waved his hand/arm in a motion like as if he wanted me to <br soft="">follow them..............this absolutely made me feel vomit rolling <br soft="">up in my guts and I couldn't move the least muscle anywhere in <br soft="">my whole entire body...........the shaking had even stopped by <br soft="">now and I was just standing there in that one spot where I had <br soft="">been the whole time this was going on...........I couldn't even <br soft="">breath.......... he took another step or two on by me, then he <br soft="">stopped and turned around and looked at me with that <br soft="">sarcastic, sinister looking smile on his face and again motioned <br soft="">for me to follow...............but I was immobile ............. it was just <br soft="">about then that I think I started to go deaf and blind all at the <br soft="">same time.........I think to this very day, I'm still going deaf and <br soft="">blind because of it ....the others kept on walking thru the <br soft="">swamp woods ...........but this one that had stopped was just <br soft="">standing there staring at me............then, all at once and very <br soft="">suddenly and very sharply, he gave his arm a snap and pointed <br soft="">his finger right straight at me........... he held his arm out straight <br soft="">and his finger pointing at me for what seemed like an <br soft="">eternity.........then, just as sharply and just as suddenly he <br soft="">jerked his arm in toward his side and my body convulsively and <br soft="">completely against my will lunged forward..........he turned and <br soft="">walked on up behind the line of 'em again with me following <br soft="">after him step for step..........I felt light as a feather and I didn't <br soft="">even feel like I was walking...............I didn't have any control of <br soft="">my legs........they just seemed to swing in mid air in an eerie <br soft="">sort of silent motion carrying me along behind this frightening <br soft="">and bizarre party of little men..................the very next thing I <br soft="">knew, as if no time had passed at all, I was at the edge of the <br soft="">swamp wood.......standing there looking up through our back <br soft="">yard..........and not a single one of those creepy lookin' little <br soft="">dudes was anywhere to be seen..........it was as if they had <br soft="">vanished into thin air.............I looked all around.........even <br soft="">behind me back into the swampy woods, but not a sign of any <br soft="">of them could I see.........all that chattering and laughing they <br soft="">had been doing was gone too............all I could hear was still a <br soft="">ringing noise in my ears and what sounded like crickets and <br soft="">frogs in the night...........when I turned back toward the house, I <br soft="">could see the back porch light and grannie was dumping some <br soft="">dishwater out the back door...........she had been defrosting her <br soft="">freezer that day and the defrost/warsh water she had in her dish <br soft="">pan was sparkling in the back porch light as it drained out of <br soft="">the pan onto the ground.............she took a step down the back <br soft="">porch steps and picked something up and put it in her duster <br soft="">pocket &nbsp;...........then she looked in my direction and hollered, " <br soft="">get in here, boy, you're liable to catch pneumonia out it this <br soft="">cool damp night air !! "...........<br>I staggered and stumbled along towards the back of the <br soft="">house...........I don't know how I mustered the strength to keep <br soft="">strugglin' along...............but somehow I did and when I got to <br soft="">the backporch steps, grannie looked down at me and said " <br soft="">don't tell anybody about what happened to you tonight till you <br soft="">get grown, because nobody will believe you and if you try to tell <br soft="">somebody about it while yer still a yungan, yer liable to get a <br soft="">whoopin' for lyin'......"<br>I never did understand and I never did ask how she knew, but <br soft="">that was that and this is the very first time I've related this <br soft="">unnerving experience to anybody...............I never told a single <br soft="">solitary soul till just now..........in this email tonight...............<br soft=""></span></font></b></span>      </div>
