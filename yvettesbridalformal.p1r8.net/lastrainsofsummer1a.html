<br soft="">the smaller Blue~Bells like a priestess performing a ritual. &nbsp;Arranging <br soft="">Wild Yellow Daisies and Red Valerian all around the edges, she <br soft="">then added one bright orange Montbretia in the very center. &nbsp;With an <br soft="">expression of triumph upon her youthful face, she stood back to <br soft="">admire her crafty creation. &nbsp;Clasping her hands together and holding <br soft="">them tightly under her chin, she whispered, &nbsp;"Brightest Blessings for <br soft="">the Bride and Groom."<br>Youghal, Ireland can be found in County Cork on the eastern shore <br soft="">of that distant green isle. &nbsp;A popular tourist destination nowadays. &nbsp;I <br soft="">could tell you a story about a young woman named Shelley Halifax. &nbsp;<br soft="">She worked as a florist in a little flower~shop during a simpler time <br soft="">when the flow of daily life was easy like a pastel palette, but when <br soft="">love of the romantic heart was as passionate and as explosive and <br soft="">as eternal as in any other time. &nbsp;Yes, I can tell you about Shelley <br soft="">Halifax and her little drama which happened in the little lives of some <br soft="">little people in a little place just south of Youghal called Valeria. &nbsp;<br soft="">Valeria, a picturesque little township so named for the Red Valerian <br soft="">which grew 'round its cottages and high on its sea~cliffs overlooking <br soft="">the violet Celtic Sea. &nbsp;It is rumored that Red Valerian was first <br soft="">brought to Ireland during early Medieval times by the Roman <br soft="">Legions who, at the behest of famous Emperors such as Hadrian, <br soft="">marched &amp; sailed ever westward seeking to further expand the <br soft="">growing boundaries of the Holy Roman Empire. &nbsp;Valeria, the quaint <br soft="">little seaside community in which our story takes place, was a <br soft="">memorable and cheerful spot where many a weary soul found <br soft="">refuge from the storms of life. &nbsp;Oh, you won't find it on any map. &nbsp;<br soft="">With all the technological progress, time itself has marched on and <br soft="">forgotten Valeria. &nbsp;In hushed tones in the shadowed corners of pubs <br soft="">late at night, it is often said that beautiful Valeria went the way of <br soft="">Atlantis or some of those sea~faring souls which have mysteriously <br soft="">disappeared in the Bermuda Triangle. &nbsp;One such story recounts how <br soft="">pretty Valeria was so loved by the Leprechauns and Faerie Folk that <br soft="">they magically transported the unsuspecting town from this world <br soft="">into their Mystical Realm beyond the Veil. &nbsp;&nbsp;According to this eerie <br soft="">Yarn, on a moonless night in late October, an unusually dense fog <br soft="">moved in from the Celtic Sea and enshrouded Valeria in the pale <br soft="">blue aura of a glowing mist. &nbsp;When the fog moved back out to sea <br soft="">just before dawn, pleasant Valeria was gone and in it's stead, a <br soft="">small inlet which to this very day hasn't been named. &nbsp;During the <br soft="">late quarter of the 19th century, however, Valeria was a thriving and <br soft="">happy little township complete with all the Victorian trappings <br soft="">befitting such a dreamy locale in such a theatrical era. &nbsp;For starters, <br soft="">Valeria was equipped with an historic town hall &amp; civic building <br soft="">which had been constructed during the Middle Ages as an Abbey by <br soft="">the Benedictine Order of Monks. &nbsp;An Anglican Chapel, built mostly <br soft="">of yew wood, served as religious center and primary school for <br soft="">Valeria. &nbsp;It was perched on a green, grassy knoll at the edge of town <br soft="">and each summer, when the tourists began their holiday visits, <br soft="">Valeria Primary School hosted a series of arts'n'crafts classes. &nbsp;The <br soft="">most popular of which was a course on pottery~making taught by <br soft="">the school's headmistress, Miss Lavender. &nbsp;Her real name was <br soft="">McBaine, but to her, Miss Lavender sounded more artistic. &nbsp;She had <br soft="">visited the desert southwest in the United States during her days at <br soft="">University when she served as assistant to the Professor of <br soft="">Archaeological Studies. &nbsp;The Navajo of the region known as the <br soft="">Painted Desert had been very cordial to Miss Lavender. &nbsp;They <br soft="">accepted her as a ceremonial member of their Tribe and gave her <br soft="">the Navajo name, Ah~Tad Le~Eh~Gade Tacheene, which means <br soft="">"girl who likes to put her hands in red soil". &nbsp;They placed her in a <br soft="">sweat~house, burned cedar and wafted the smoke over her with an <br soft="">eagle feather. &nbsp;During her field research, Miss Lavender had made <br soft="">many exciting artistic discoveries among the mesas, canyons and <br soft="">cacti. &nbsp;The Navajo people taught her much about their ancestral <br soft="">pottery~making methods which, of course, accounted for the <br soft="">popularity of her pottery workshop during summers at Valeria <br soft="">Primary School. &nbsp;Miss Lavender told many humorous anecdotes of <br soft="">her adventures, and she related tales of Navajo Mysticism, Legends <br soft="">and Lore. &nbsp;The main point of interest and tourist destination in <br soft="">Valeria Township, however, was not the Primary School, but the <br soft="">hotel resort for which Valeria's fame had spread throughout the <br soft="">length and breadth of Ireland and a place or two in foreign lands. &nbsp;<br soft="">Shell House was a sleepy little coastal resort with just 21 guest <br soft="">rooms of modest and antiquarian decor. &nbsp;Shell House also had one <br soft="">Bridal Suite &amp; one Bungalow, each opulently outfitted for any rich <br soft="">patrons who could afford the finest luxuries of the day. &nbsp;The <br soft="">proprietors of Shell House were Mr. &amp; Mrs. Nolan. &nbsp;A charming Irish <br soft="">country couple whose pedigree included Sir Edmund Raleigh. &nbsp;<br soft="">Living the life of a humble country squire, Sir Edmund was believed <br soft="">to be a sometime confidant of Sir Walter Long who was a friend to <br soft="">Sir Walter Raleigh, who sold his lands to Richard Boyle, the 1st Earl <br soft="">of Cork who was also 1st Baron Boyle of Youghal and Lord High <br soft="">Treasurer of the Kingdom of Ireland during the reign of Queen <br soft="">Elizabeth the First in the late 1500's. &nbsp;Mr. and Mrs. Nolan were, in <br soft="">addition to being brilliant conversationalists, cute, cuddly and elderly <br soft="">so that over the years they cultivated a loyal clientele, many of whom <br soft="">were regulars at Shell House every summer.<br soft=""></span></font></span></td>

Mrs. Nolan shouted. &nbsp;"He was supposed to be <br soft="">back with the extra tablecloths by now!"<br>"He's coming around the back, Mrs. Nolan." Shelley replied as she <br soft="">walked into the banquet hall with another beautiful flower <br soft="">arrangement. &nbsp;"Only three more of these and I can run home to <br soft="">change into my fancy dress! &nbsp;I'll just have time to make it to the <br soft="">Chapel and be seated before the Bride walks down the aisle!"<br>Mrs. Nolan looked pleadingly at Shelley Halifax and made a request <br soft="">which she knew wouldn't please her, &nbsp;"Oh, Shelley, would you be a <br soft="">dear and help take the rest of the lily bouquets to the guest rooms? &nbsp;<br soft="">And convey the special flower arrangements to the Bridal Suite and <br soft="">the Bungalow as well? &nbsp;Mr. Lynch will be arriving this afternoon and <br soft="">I want everything to be perfect for all our guests, especially for the <br soft="">Bride and Groom and especially for Mr. Lynch." &nbsp;<br>Mr. Liam Lynch was the thirty~one year old son of a wealthy banker. <br soft="">&nbsp;As was customary for the wealthy classes, he was educated at <br soft="">private schools during his childhood but then, rather than go <br soft="">straight to University, Liam Lynch spent his early twenties traveling <br soft="">the world. &nbsp;He was now preparing for his last year of formal <br soft="">education at Cambridge following this summer. &nbsp;After that he was <br soft="">sure to take over his aging father's position as senior officer of the <br soft="">Lynch Merchant's Bank, headquartered in Dublin.<br>"Where's Dolores?" Shelley asked with a bit of disappointment in <br soft="">her voice.<br>"She's not feeling well again. &nbsp;I sent her to Doc Kirwan. &nbsp;She put up <br soft="">her usual quiet objectionable resistance, of course, but I bade Gillan <br soft="">to see her to the good doctor's and then return quickly with the extra <br soft="">tablecloths we need from your Grandmother."<br soft=""></span></font></span></td>

Feid's mother was happy in New <br soft="">York because of the increase in income. &nbsp;Feid's brothers and sisters <br soft="">had all gotten jobs of one sort or another and married and settled <br soft="">into the Big City quite well. &nbsp;Feid, however, was always homesick for <br soft="">Ireland and vacationed each summer at Shell House. &nbsp;The Friendly <br soft="">Flower Shoppe provides flowers daily for the guest rooms at Shell <br soft="">House during the summer tourist season, so this made it inevitable <br soft="">that Lilian and Feid would encounter each other. &nbsp;After a number of <br soft="">such encounters during such summers Feid asked Lilian to marry <br soft="">him and she gladly accepted. &nbsp;They had since had three girls. &nbsp;<br soft="">Imogen, the oldest at 15, Eileen shortly after her at 13 and the <br soft="">youngest Rowan daughter, Aislinn, was just 6 years old. &nbsp;Aislinn <br soft="">loved the fact that her name means dream and she was constantly <br soft="">reminding everyone in Valeria of her name's meaning and of just <br soft="">how much it meant to her. &nbsp;<br>Shelley Halifax helped look after the Rowan girls and was just as <br soft="">another member of the family. &nbsp;Kind of like a second mother to <br soft="">Imogen, Eileen and Aislinn since Shelley herself was only seven <br soft="">years younger than Lilian. &nbsp;<br>During autumn, winter and spring, the Friendly Flower Shoppe <br soft="">shipped lovely flower arrangements and bouquets to all parts of <br soft="">Ireland, especially the capital, Dublin and even by steamship to <br soft="">London on occasion. &nbsp;This meant that the Friendly Flower Shoppe <br soft="">was always busy, especially so during summers with the steady <br soft="">flow of guests at Shell House. &nbsp;It was during these busy summers <br soft="">that Lilian and Feid needed, along with Shelley, some additional <br soft="">assistance at the Friendly Flower Shoppe, which is where Sean <br soft="">Quinn emerges into our story. &nbsp;<br>Sean Quinn was the youngest son in a very large family which lived <br soft="">on a potato farm a few miles inland from Valeria. &nbsp;Sean's family also <br soft="">herded sheep and even grew strawberries to have as a pleasant <br soft="">treat in season. &nbsp;This was a novelty for the local area residents <br soft="">because during that time, Ireland's strawberries were almost entirely <br soft="">imported from England and Holland. &nbsp;Sean, at the tender age of 24, <br soft="">didn't fancy the farm life other than as a ready subject for his <br soft="">drawings and paintings. &nbsp;A reclusive and soft spoken young man, <br soft="">Sean did his share of work to help out around the farm, but he had <br soft="">big dreams of becoming a world famous painter someday. &nbsp;Sean <br soft="">Quinn loved art. &nbsp;Sean loved to draw and he loved to paint all that <br soft="">he saw in the big bright beautiful world around him. &nbsp;Sean loved <br soft="">drawing and painting portraits of people most of all. &nbsp;Portraiture was <br soft="">the endeavor which mystically called to him more than any other <br soft="">facet of life. &nbsp;To Sean, it was magic to start with a blank space and <br soft="">scrub and scribble and erase, then scrub and scribble again until a <br soft="">very real likeness of a human being appeared on the sketch paper <br soft="">or canvas before him. &nbsp;Sean, though self taught, was dramatically <br soft="">skilled at portraiture. &nbsp;Many assured Sean and repeated as much <br soft="">among themselves that he would indeed become a very successful <br soft="">and world famous painter. &nbsp;This encouragement was music to <br soft="">Sean's ears and he carried on in vigorous pursuit of his daring <br soft="">dream. &nbsp;Yes, painting, especially portraiture, was magic to Sean. &nbsp;<br soft="">Sean was a Sorcerer. &nbsp;His charcoal and brushes, his magic wands. &nbsp;<br soft="">Drawing and painting portraits, his magic.<br>Naturally, an artist would also be drawn to flowers. &nbsp;Sean Quinn, in <br soft="">order to escape what was to him the drudgery of the farm, worked <br soft="">helping Lilian, Feid and, his favorite, Shelley at the Friendly Flower <br soft="">Shoppe. &nbsp;Imogen and Eileen loved helping Miss Lavender with the <br soft="">arts'n'crafts classes at Valeria Primary School. &nbsp;Aislinn got to play <br soft="">with the other very young children during those happy summers at <br soft="">the little Anglican Chapel, so Sean lending a hand with the Friendly <br soft="">Flower Shoppe made everything work out nicely for everyone. &nbsp;<br soft="">Sean's primary duties were sweeping, mopping, emptying the trash <br soft="">receptacles and delivering flowers but once in a while, he got to <br soft="">assist with creating the actual flower arrangements themselves. &nbsp;<br soft="">Sometimes Lilian would show him a thing or two about the art of <br soft="">flower arranging, sometimes Feid and sometimes even Shelley. &nbsp;He <br soft="">loved it when Shelley let him assist her, though he never breathed a <br soft="">word about how much he really liked her. &nbsp;In fact, Sean never said <br soft="">much of anything at all. &nbsp;<br soft=""></span></font></span></td>
