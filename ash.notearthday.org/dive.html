<p align="right"><i>01.27.2001, 02.15.2001</i></P>
<P align="center">All my hiding places are no longer secret<br>
the further I run, the closer I get</P>
<P align="center">I run from the pain, I try to conceal<br>
I put on a face that hides what I feel</P>
<P align="center">I can lie to everyone but not to myself<br>
my love for her cant be put on a shelf</P>
<P align="center">Not an hour goes by without her in my thoughts<br>
and while my heart still beats, the rest of me rots</P>
<P align="center">I cant think of her without thinking of whats gone<br>
no matter how many claim that I can move on</P>
<P align="center">it's been a long time since I felt I wanted to live<br>
since someone returned the love I could give</P>
<P align="center">3 years of happiness, 3 years of crying<br>
a mask of denial, dying and lying</P>
<P align="center">I'm broken and all thats left is to die<br>
everyone says "hang in there" but I don't see why</P>
<P align="center">why should I go on when I feel this way<br>
let me let go, let me fade away</P>
<P align="center">let me say goodbye let me end this hurt<br>
you don't have to remember me when I'm in the dirt</P>
<P align="center">I had my taste of love<br>
my temporary happiness</P>
<P align="center">I envy the dead<br>
because they don't have to feel this</P>

<P align="right"><i>Thursday, December 21, 2000</i></P>
<P align="center">It's been a year since I was here<br>
yet time's not dried a single tear</P>
<P align="center">I've come a long way since then<br>
all the way back to where I started<br>
and now I cry again<br>
lost and broken-hearted</P>
<P align="center">It wasn't meant to be, I see that now<br>
but I'd give anything if it could be different, somehow.</P>
<P align="center">I don't know who I am now<br>
don't know who I will be<br>
don't know quite how<br>
she fell in love with me</P>
<P align="center">the only thing I can say I've learned<br>
through this eternity of hurt</P>
<P align="center">is that the isolation, the bridges burned<br>
have left me with less than dirt</P>
<P align="center">I don't know where to go from here<br>
don't know how to carry on<br>
when swimming in this pain and fear<br>
the love, the joy, the reason is gone.</P>
<P align="center">So here I stand, or rather, kneel<br>
here I sit and cry<br>
drowning in that which I feel<br>
and I can't even ask why.</P>
<P align="center">I would give anything just to feel<br>
the love I felt before<br>
if I had anything to give, I'd trade it<br>
to not feel this anymore</P>
<P align="center">so now I look around myself<br>
the terrain is unfamiliar<br>
I see it in my memories<br>
along with images of her</P>
<P align="center">All I have left are dreams and tears<br>
and the fullfillment of my greatest fears<br>
the loss of all that I held dear<br>
and now I'm the only one here</P>
<P align="center">except I don't know where here is<br>
I don't know where I've been<br>
after I've played all my cards<br>
what do I do then?</P>
<hr width="30%">
<h3 align="center"><font color="#FF0000"><b>untitled 1</b></font></h3>
<P align="center">
there was a time, not too long ago<br>
when i had more than i will ever know<br>
the love, the caring, the trust<br>
the happiness, my purpose, has all turned to dust</P>
<P align="center">and then there was a time<br>
when it all disappeared<br>
and i'm left with just images<br>
and just what i feared</P>
<P align="center">i truly believed<br>
that it was meant to be<br>
but such good things<br>
are not meant for me</P>
<P align="center">whenever i get close<br>
it all goes away<br>
i had the world<br>
but it didn't stay</P>
<P align="center">I traded it all<br>
for a life of pain<br>
worked so hard to be content<br>
but it was all in vain</P>
<P align="center">i thought that everything<br>
was worth the effort<br>
but through all my trying<br>
i'm left with just hurt</P>
<P align="center">i dont know why they all tell me<br>
that i should go on<br>
when my reason to be<br>
is forever gone</P>
<P align="center">now i'm left with myself<br>
and even that is gone<br>
because it left when she did<br>
but she can move on</P>
<P align="center">the meaning, the purpose<br>
my reason to live<br>
now spits in my face<br>
i gave all i could give</P>
<P align="center">what more could she want<br>
that i didnt do<br>
or was she just lying<br>
when she said "I love you"</P>
<hr width="30%">
<h3 align="center"><font color="#FF0000"><b>untitled 2</b></font></h3>
<P align="center">is there something I'm missing<br>
something I've yet to see<br>
some purpose for living<br>
when hurting so badly?</P>
<P align="center">I've been loved<br>
I've been wanted<br>
I've been hurt<br>
and betrayed</P>
<P align="center">how I feel<br>
will not heal<br>
is this how<br>
the game is played?</P>
<P align="center">why can't someone tell me<br>
why I must endure this pain<br>
why I must be shown that<br>
any effort will be in vain</P>
<P align="center">I can't find any reason<br>
anything to justify<br>
you have no right to tell me<br>
that it's okay to cry</P>
<hr width="30%">
<h3 align="center"><font color="#FF0000"><b> untitled 3</b></font></h3>
<P align="center">they tell me not to do it<br>
they say don't give up<br>
it will all be okay, it'll get better someday<br>
but i cant believe it</P>
<P align="center">so im still hanging on<br>
to what I don't know<br>
because of the friends<br>
who wont let me let go</P>
<P align="center">i cant run from myself<br>
i cant hide from how i feel<br>
i cant act like its worth it<br>
these wounds will not heal</P>
<P align="center">I'm glad that she's found someone<br>
with whom she's satisfied<br>
I had found one, but she left,<br>
and part of me died</P>
<P align="center">words cannot explain just how much it hurts<br>
no amount of tears can convey<br>
the feelings that assault me<br>
since I heard her say</P>
<P align="center">that she is happy, she loves him, she wishes he was there<br>
she's glad they're together, I'm dying but does she care?</P>
<P align="center">she tells me that I dont really love her<br>
that she's changed through the years<br>
regardless of that my love perseveres</P>
<P align="center">she means everything in the world to me<br>
I mean nothing to her</P>
<P align="center">and she asks why I'm crying<br>
she asks what is wrong<br>
and then when i tell her<br>
she knew all along</P>
<P align="center">i would trade everything i have<br>
just to go back and hear her say<br>
'I love you, Sean', I would give my life for one day</P>
<P align="center">a day back when she used to tell me she cared<br>
when she'd tell me that if i need her she'd always be there</P>
<P align="center">Michele, I love you, I can't just "get over it"<br>
you are the one person in the world<br>
who ever made living worth it</P>
<P align="center">but alas, she is gone, I'm here, she's moved on<br>
I have never felt pain as deep as I do<br>
I can't let go but I cant make her want me too</P>
<hr width="30%">
<h3 align="center"><font color="#FF0000"><b>Promises (broken)</b></font></h3>
<P align="right"><i>
November 25, 2000</i></P>
<P align="center">"Life isn't fair" is the most truthful statement I've heard<br>
and "I love you, Sean" - love's the most painful word -<br>
on one side it's the best, its so beautiful, so good<br>
and on the other, it hurts more than anyone could.</P>
<P align="center">Because when you hurt from love, it's not something you can ignore<br>
love comes from within you, if you run, it will only hurt more<br>
Falling in love with her was the best feeling I'd ever felt<br>
and the loss of her love was the worst blow life has dealt</P>
<P align="center">I've done more crying than I can remember<br>
and through it all I can say I still love her<br>
but I am forced to acknowledge sadly<br>
that she was lying when she said she'd always love me</P>
<P align="center">Did I ever really mean anything to her?<br>
was I really special or was I just another?<br>
another heart broken, another person destroyed<br>
whats more painful, the end, or the means that are employed?</P>
<P align="center">I have made one promise that I have not broken<br>
I promised I would never give up, no matter how badly heartbroken<br>
is it really worth it, to suffer through this<br>
just for the satisfaction of the one who gave me death's kiss?</P>
<P align="center">I don't have the strength to keep getting hurt<br>
I don't need it proven again that I am less than dirt<br>
You dont need to tell me it will all be okay<br>
for I know it's just bullshit, it won't be that way</P>
<P align="center">The last years have proven that that was a lie,<br>
the only way it will get better, is if i die.<br>
I cant stop feeling this, I cant numb the pain<br>
but I can end it, that much is plain.</P>
<P align="center">I don't know if I have the courage or not,<br>
to take my own life (what life?) what strength have I got?<br>
I have nothing thats not borrowed feelings<br>
which come from the friends and the failed healings</P>
<P align="center">When it comes down to it, I have nothing at all,<br>
except pain, sweet pain, endless pain, endless hurt<br>
and the knowledge that it was all for naught, that it was all<br>
from the first moment, destined to end</P>
<P align="center">Well, I can never be sure, as to her intentions<br>
but I can be sure that I don't plan to stay around<br>
if all I'm here for<br>
is to be smashed into the ground</P>
<P align="center">If I suddenly disappear, if my life ended<br>
even if I didn't do it, it was what I intended<br>
I don't know if I will be here tomorrow<br>
but if not, my friends, know i did not mean any sorrow</P>
<P align="center">I dont want you to hurt on my behalf<br>
if I am gone, be happy, that my pain is gone<br>
and please remember me as the person I was<br>
before the pain piled on.</P>
<P align="center">If I am still here, tomorrow and the day after<br>
I will still be your friend, and I will still love her<br>
I won't make any promises, I want to live, but I don't<br>
the best days are behind me, the best memories</P>
<P align="center">of when life was pure and wonderful and I wanted to be there<br>
when I was with her the joy was everywhere<br>
I wanted to be with her for the rest of time<br>
but it wasnt meant to happen, the happiness was wiped away by time</P>
<P align="center">time is the enemy<br>
time makes all that is good worthless<br>
for in a thousand years<br>
no-one will even remember I said this</P>
<P align="center">in a thousand years<br>
my name won't ring a bell<br>
and nobody will know<br>
of my life in this hell</P>
<P align="center">my suffering through this, wont mean a thing<br>
to those who have never heard my crying<br>
to my friends - you have done more for me<br>
than you will ever know, just listening to me</P>
<P align="center">just being around, a shoulder to cry on<br>
is enough to convince me<br>
that i should live on<br>
i wont ask anything</P>
<P align="center">anymore, from anyone<br>
but just dont break a promise,<br>
if you're going to make one.</P>
<P align="center"><br>
why wont you let me let go?</P>
<hr width="30%">
<h3 align="center"><font color="#FF0000"><b>untitled 4</b></font></h3>
<P align="center">The one that I love<br>
has left me behind<br>
how can you tell me<br>
that I will find</P>
<P align="center">another who wants me<br>
another who cares<br>
another who loves me<br>
who will always be there</P>
<P align="center">how am I supposed to trust<br>
when I am so broken<br>
my world abruptly turned to dust<br>
the moment those words were spoken.</P>
<P align="center">but to my suprise<br>
I find a glimmer of light<br>
a sparkle of beauty<br>
in this endless night.</P>
<P align="center">the pain is not gone;<br>
it is still there<br>
but at least now I feel<br>
that I'm getting somewhere</P>
<P align="center">I dont know how<br>
to proceed from here<br>
it's all I can do<br>
to push through the fear</P>
<P align="center">but it's a welcome feeling<br>
to be given some hope<br>
when I was just about<br>
at the end of my rope</P>
<P align="center">Perhaps it is possible<br>
to find someone who<br>
I can hold on to<br>
someone who wants me too.</P>
<hr width="30%">
<h3 align="center"><font color="#FF0000"><b>untitled 5</b></font></h3>
<P align="center">
day after day<br>
I reach a new level of despair<br>
I can't even say<br>
that I really care</P>
<P align="center">I don't have the energy<br>
to do anything but cry<br>
pain is all thats left of me<br>
and nobody can tell me why</P>
<P align="center">the only thing I look forward to<br>
is the day I draw my last breath<br>
i hope it comes soon<br>
serenity in death</P>
<P align="center">being alive has lost all its meaning<br>
or maybe I've found the secret<br>
maybe it never meant anything<br>
and nobody's noticed yet?</P>
<P align="center">if you want to tell me to live<br>
thats all well and good<br>
I suppose I can forgive<br>
since you never understood.</P>
<P align="center">dont tell me you'll miss me<br>
dont say that you care<br>
you lie so obviously<br>
you were never there</P>
<P align="center">maybe I'm dead already<br>
and this is hell<br>
it wouldnt suprise me<br>
theres only one way to tell</P>
<P align="center">everyone tells me<br>
that they dont want me dead<br>
but they dont see<br>
what goes on in my head</P>
<P align="center">walk a mile in my shoes<br>
go ahead, try<br>
and see if you dont agree<br>
that it'd be better to die
