<h2>A poem by Bernadette Simpson</h2>
<hr>
This poem was posted to a.s.h on Mon 25th September, by Robb Simpson, in
memoriam of his late wife, Bernadette.
<hr>
<i>Robb writes :</i> This comes from a writing by my deceased wife, Bernadette,
who committed suicide in November of 1991.
<hr>
Life is challenging<br>
To be - is challenging<br>
Bravo! To those that have the courage<br>
to be human beings rather than human doings.<br>
My love is genuuine, honest, and tainted<br>
only by the past - my childhood.<br>
Not by what you all bestowed upon me in gracious gifts,<br>
that today, I still feel unworthy of.<br>
Once again echoes of my past.<br>
My legacy to you is one of communication,<br>
honesty, dignity for oneself as others,<br>
integrity, security, love, consistency,<br>
and being human.<br>
Accepting all of our own unique, individual<br>
(but always human part) that keeps us connected<br>
with our hearts.
<p>TO BE READ UPON THE DEATH OF MARIE BERNADETTE SIMPSON D.O.B. APRIL 14, 1962
D.O.D.
<hr>
<p><i>Robb writes :</i> I was doing some cleaning up of my basement when I came
across this diary of Bernie's. I felt that I owed her this to post what she had
written because it was never read out loud as she requested (I didn't even know
it existed). It was written sometime in February, 1991.
<p>Keep the faith
