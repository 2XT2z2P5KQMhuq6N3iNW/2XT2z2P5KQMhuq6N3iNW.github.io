<p>In an article in <u>The New Republic</u>, Robert Wright touched on many USENET
newsgroups.&nbsp; Followring are his comments about alt.suicide.holiday:</p>

<p><font color="#FFFF00">...Alt.suicide.holiday, billed as a discussion of why suicide
rates grow during holidays, turns out to consist partly of people trying to help each
other get undepressed. There is something truly affecting, not to mention dramatic, about
watching a person who may be contemplating suicide get help from someone who knows the
territory.</font><font color="#FF0000"> &quot;This is my survival list &amp; I walk the
edge often.... Walking randomly until either my mind shuts up or my feet hurt.... I make
myself call a friend.... I look at my dog and try to figure out who will take care of him
and treat him well and spoil him if I off myself (I save this for the worst times.... I
can't bear to take him with me &amp; I can't bear to leave him behind). A pet helps. I
pick an object. Anything, a plant, a jar, a piece of string on the carpet, a cat hair on
the couch &amp; I study it. I try to imagine different uses for it. I try to become
whatever it is. I try to connect and imagine that object's connection with everything
else. If I can somehow feel that link/connection then I know I am not completely alone
&amp; that I am connected (however tenuously) to this world &amp; that I sorta belong here
even if it seems I don't fit in with whatever is happening.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFF00">This sort of communication is the essence of the Net. As fun as
it is to sit and watch fringe groups sound frivolous, most newsgroup traffic is from
serious people finding communication they need or, at least, really want. And the level of
discourse, though uneven, is often very high...</font> </p>
