<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000"><big><strong>Fun Times</strong></big></font></p>

<p align="center">It&#146;s at that point -<br>
when trust in fellow man withers,<br>
that the soul retires and quietly dies.<br>
It is no longer lost.</p>

<p align="center">Beyond the feint glimmer of hope &#150;<br>
a realisation that all is not good,<br>
that human nature is intrinsically evil.<br>
Society is not to blame.</p>

<p align="center">We are all products of our choices &#150;<br>
some, however, can find a means<br>
to change to a more nirvanic ideal.<br>
The majority will perish.</p>

<p align="center">A goal to make the world happy -<br>
sadly forfeited when the toughest<br>
decision of all is made.<br>
The choice to say enough&#146;s enough.</p>

<hr align="center" width="30%">

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000"><big><strong>Small Business <em>(A Late 1990's
Analogy)</em></strong></big></font></p>

<p align="center">At times we take must count of all that we are<br>
- and are not. An audit if you like -<br>
of our life's achievements and failures to date. And -<br>
we realise then, in our subjective look at ourselves,<br>
that we do not have as much as we once believed.</p>

<p align="center">We are told that it is not the tangible which<br>
should hold interest our heart, as these things<br>
can so easily be removed from our lives. So, in a<br>
determined effort to control our destiny, we invest<br>
our time and energies in those we care for.<br>
Our friends - our family - ourselves.</p>

<p align="center">As we tally the columns, the realisation of a<br>
net loss becomes clear. Pain, sorrow, remorse,<br>
mistrust and anger are the bottom line. Our<br>
friends cannot suffer as a consequence - they<br>
never went guarantor for our life. The family<br>
should cannot be expected to bail out the<br>
bankrupt soul.</p>

<p align="center">It's then that confidence is lost in the principle -<br>
we see a businessman running a failing business. The<br>
real world has answers for such eventualities.<br>
In the surreal world of the intangible - the world<br>
in which we are told to invest so heavily -<br>
there are no such trategies. We can fail and we are<br>
permitted (encouraged?) to continue failing - ad<br>
infinitum till the day we decide it's time.</p>

<p align="center">Foreclosure.</p>

<hr align="center" width="30%">

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000"><strong><big>Another day - Felo-de-se</big></strong></font></p>

<p align="center">It's on life-support now -<br>
not willing to continue;<br>
not seeing hope;<br>
no longer feeling warmth.</p>

<p align="center">The body, like<br>
a cruel iron lung<br>
forces it to persist.<br>
Day in. Day out</p>

<p align="center">When a body is dying<br>
they gather around.<br>
&quot;Let him go - it will<br>
be a happy release&quot;.<br>
The machine is turned<br>
off.</p>

<p align="center">They'll cry<br>
They'll comfort<br>
They'll smile<br>
They'll continue</p>

<p align="center">But, here, the soul<br>
suffers. The body<br>
cloaking its every<br>
spasm. They see<br>
only the man - the<br>
cancered soul<br>
is deeply hidden.</p>

<p align="center">&quot;The cowards way out&quot;,<br>
they scream angrily.</p>

<p align="center">They cry<br>
They hurt<br>
They rile<br>
They halt.</p>

<p align="center">And they fail to see. It's<br>
just the soul being taken<br>
off life support. It's<br>
now at peace. A happy<br>
release.</p>

<hr align="center" width="30%">

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000"><strong><big>The Loneliest Departure Lounge</big></strong></font></p>

<p align="center">He listened, bemused, to the gifted orator<br>
on the TV - &quot;Dream&quot; he said, &quot;dream<br>
and enjoy all that life has to offer the children<br>
of the world&quot;. But what, he pondered,<br>
would this orator say if he knew that all he<br>
dreamed about was dying? </p>

<p align="center">See - he sits in a departure lounge,<br>
not unlike one in a small airport.<br>
There is a handful of people here. The<br>
passengers know not where they are going,<br>
and yet, the know where they need to be. </p>

<p align="center">They wait patiently for their plane, dreaming<br>
of their intended destination. All aircraft lead<br>
to the same place but their forms take many<br>
shapes. Some are huge gas-belching monsters -<br>
offering a slow, turbulence-free ride. Others<br>
are no smaller than a plastic jar but will get<br>
there just as quick. Some folks don't like planes<br>
so they will abandon this airport and take the<br>
bullet train instead. </p>

<p align="center">He casts his eyes around the terminal. There are<br>
a couple of friends and relatives crying from the<br>
distant realm of the airport doors. They've come<br>
to wave the travellers off - knowing most of them<br>
will never return home. Some of our travellers<br>
haven't even let their associates know of their travel<br>
plans. This is their choice. </p>

<p align="center">Non-travellers don't understand why these folks are<br>
leaving - so many will call them &quot;weak&quot; for wanting<br>
to leave. Most will never understand. If only they<br>
knew how hard it is to get on the plane - then they'd<br>
understand, too, why there are still people sitting<br>
in the lounge. Even the folks who want to fly, at times,<br>
have a fear of flying.</p>
