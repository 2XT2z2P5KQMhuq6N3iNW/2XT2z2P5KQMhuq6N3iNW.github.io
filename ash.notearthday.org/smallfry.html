<P align="center">No one cares that, that snowman will not live a long live  <br>
He will melt away to nothingness<br>

Its the dark grin ripper coming<br>
and claming this life away.</P>

You ask why I am I crying<br>
Why I shed tears<br>
in these times of hard ship<br>
Why not smile! You say<br>
Is there really something to smile about?<br>
People die every day.<br>
Starving<br>
killing<br>
Suicide<br>
war<br>
hate<br>
many of those who die<br>
don't wish to die<br>
other have no choice<br>
but are driven' to death<br>
you ask why I'm crying<br>
I ask how can you smile.<br>
how can you smile<br>
an innocent child is killed of hunger<br>
well another is driven to suicide

We always said we'd be friends tell the end, right?<br>
Until along came that unforgiving night<br>
You never knew how much you changed me<br>
people always say thetas the way things were meant to be<br>
I'd always planned to do it together<br>
but you just couldn't wait forever<br>
I called you up<br>
and yet you never answered<br>
little did I know,<br>
I thought, maybe shes just not home<br>
maybe she went out for a walk<br>
the morning after came so slowly<br>
as my phone began to ring<br>
I felt so happy and joyful<br>
but only to answer it and hear the voice of your sister<br>
why'd you have to do it<br>
you couldn't wait just one more year<br>
We could have died together<br>
a smile then a tear<br>
friends till the end, right?<br>
this ending came too soon<br>
As I stay in my house thinking of you<br>
hoping you some place where you are happy<br>
just waiting<br>
for the day I join you<br>
soon my friend soon</P>
<hr width="30%">
<p class="item-title"><a name="alone again">alone again</a></p>
<P align="center">Alone again is what I'll be<br>
why can't you people see<br>
I was made this way<br>
and forever I shall stay<br>
my friend all seem to betray me<br>
whether it be a she or a he<br>
no one ever loves me<br>
they say they do<br>
there all lieing too<br>
no one will ever love me<br>
no one will ever see</P><hr width="30%">
<p class="item-title"><a name="THE DARKNESS">THE DARKNESS</a></p>
<P align="center">the darkness seems to grow every day<br>
isnt ever way<br>
I try to put on a smile and be happy<br>
to make the peopel around me happy<br>
for all  I want is for all the people<br>
around me to be joyful<br>
I don't want for any one else to feel these pain<br>
I wish you all to be happy<br>
I am a lost sole<br>
don't try to help me now<br>
I've sunken to deep in the depth of the hole of darkness<br>
no more loving<br>
no more caring<br>
no more tears that shall be cryed<br>
as this darkness seems to grow it swollows me a whole</P><hr width="30%">
<p class="item-title"><a name="Happy ending">Happy ending</a></p>
<P align="center">When I was young people used to read my stories that always ended happyly<br>
I always thought that was the way every thing would be<br>
or at least was ment to be<br>
I shall always wish my friend the best of luck and love<br>
I care deeply about them all<br>
none of them ever will know the way I feel<br>
the darkness that takes over me<br>
I always try to be happy with them<br>
they are my new friends<br>
but I love them none the less<br>
they care so much about me<br>
I'm only afraid I'll hurt them more<br>
so when I leave to my happy world<br>
please don't shed a tear for me<br>
unless it be a tear of happyness<br>
for you shall know I have gone on to a better place<br>
to a place where I feel no more pain<br>
and cause no more pain<br>
live your life a happy life<br>
for now my life has ended<br>
and we all lived happyly ever after my death</P><hr width="30%">
<p class="item-title"><a name="Leaving">Leaving</a></p>
<P align="center">Don't cry<br>
don't be sad<br>
I'm gone now<br>
never to return<br>
I'm leaving now<br>
as the world slowly fades away from me<br>
I'm leaving on a happy train<br>
but don't you worry<br>
you will not need to join me<br>
I'll be meeting some old friend there<br>
in the new happy little place<br>
I'll hope to see you in many many years<br>
in the happy little place<br>
I waves good bye<br>
and tell you once more not to cry<br>
for you have many more years  ahead<br>

all  I ever want to do is die<br>
would it be soo easy<br>
I know it may sounds chessey<br>
just lay my neck upon the track<br>
never ending don't look back<br>
I hear the train around the corner<br>
soon I'll be headed to the morner<br>
oh happy day nothing more to say</P>

<P align="center">
" is that blood?"<br>
" no no not at all "<br>
as the warm red liquid<br>
slowly pour from my broken vain<br>
creaping its way down my arm<br>
I cut again and again deeper and deeper<br>
then the warm red liquide is all I can see<br>
I feel  light headed<br>
THUD<br>
I fall to the floor never to arise again<br>
good night<br>
good night all<br>
