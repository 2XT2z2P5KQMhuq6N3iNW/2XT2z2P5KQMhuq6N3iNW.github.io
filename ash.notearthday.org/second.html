OK.  This has been considered and discussed on the internet
for years on end.  Obviously the person who invented that little 
webpage never bothered researching much on USENET, or reading the 
things like the alt.suicide.holiday FAQ.  It is only one of a 
myriad reasons for suicide.

[snip of reasoning following an incorrectly absolutist statement]&nbsp;<br>
 
"Now I want to tell you five things to think about. <br>
-------------------------<br>
1. The first thing you need to hear is that people do get through this --
even people who feel as badly as you are feeling now. Statistically, there
is a very good chance that you are going to live. I hope that this
information gives you some sense of hope."
</font>
</td><td width="50%"></td></tr><td width="50%"></td><td width="50%">
<i>
<font color="#00FFFF">
Actually, that information has often produces a sense of despair on 
internet suicide discussion groups.  Which the author would know
if he'd bothered to research, instead of preaching to an audience - you -
that's had way too much preaching already.
</font>
</i>
</td><tr><td width="50%">
<font color="#FFFF00">
"2. The next thing I want to suggest
to you is to give yourself some distance. Say to yourself, 'I will wait 24
hours before I do anything.' Or a week. Remember that feelings and actions"
</font>
</td><td width="50%"></td></tr><td width="50%"></td><td width="50%">
<i>
<font color="#00FFFF">
Contract # 2.
</font>
</i>
</td><tr><td width="50%">
<font color="#FFFF00">
"3. The third thing is this: people often turn to suicide because they
are seeking relief from pain. Remember that relief is a feeling. And you
have to be alive to feel it. "
</font>
</td><td width="50%"></td></tr><td width="50%"></td><td width="50%">
<i>
<font color="#00FFFF">
Of course not.  Relief is simply an absence of pressure.  Being dead
gives relief from any pressure of life in a complete and absolute
manner.
</font>
</i>
</td><tr><td width="50%">
<font color="#FFFF00">
"4. The fourth thing is this: some people
will react badly to your suicidal feelings, either because they are
frightened, or angry; they may actually increase your pain instead of
helping you, despite their intentions, by saying or doing thoughtless
things. You have to understand that their bad reactions are about their
fears, not about you. 
<p> 
&quot;But there are people out there who can be with you in this horrible time,
and will not judge you, or argue with you, or send you to a hospital, or
try to talk you out of how badly you feel. They will simply care for you."
</font>
</td><td width="50%"></td></tr><td width="50%"></td><td width="50%">
<font color="#00FFFF">
<i>Uh, yeah.
Obviously under-researched. </i>
<P>
<i>The "will not argue" is as specious as the entire web-page.
Of course they won't argue.  They'll state their own invented 
definitions that have no connection to reality - just like the
web page - and drone it at you until you get frustrated enough
to hang up. </i>
</font>
</td><tr><td width="50%">
<font color="#FFFF00">
"Find one of them. Now. Use your 24 hours, or your week, and tell someone
what's going on with you. It is okay to ask for help. Call a crisis line
(in NYC try the Samaritans at 212-673-3000, or call a branch near you, or
look in the front of your phone book), call a psychotherapist, carefully
choose a friend or a minister or rabbi, someone who is likely to listen."

</td><td width="50%"></td></tr><td width="50%"></td><td width="50%">
<i>
<font color="#00FFFF">
Psychotherapists have to report imminent danger.  This lie has been disproved
numerous times by the experience of posters to alt.suicide.holiday.
They -will- send people to a hospital, which makes
the webpage either a ridiculous farrago of ignorance, or (more likely
in my opinion, given the well-designed psychological method) a deliberate
lie designed to incarcerate people to receive psychological and 
psychiatric "help".  Some crisis lines also report imminent danger
as well.
</font>
</i>
</td><tr><td width="50%">
<font color="#FFFF00">
"But don't give yourself the additional burden of trying to deal with this
alone. Just talking about how you got to where you are, releases an awful
lot of the pressure, and it might be just the additional coping resource
you need to regain your balance.

<i>
<font color="#00FFFF">
Of course, you can do this by posting to alt.suicide.holiday through an anon service,
such as anonymizer or nym.  But then it'd be harder to get the address to send those
white jackets to on a timely basis..
</font>
</i>
</td><tr><td width="50%">
<font color="#FFFF00">
"5. The last thing I want you to know right now is this: Suicidal feelings
are, in and of themselves, traumatic. After they subside, you need to
continue caring for yourself. "

Sometimes it is.. sometimes it's not.  It depends on the therapist.
Many therapists are horrible.. a few are very good.

"various self-help groups available both in your community and on the
Internet and various online services.
