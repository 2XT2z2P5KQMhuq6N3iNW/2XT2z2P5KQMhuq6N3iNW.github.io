<h2>In the Arms of Death</h2>
<p>At midnight the moonlight comes in by a window,<br>
it melts all over the quilt on my bed;<br>
I am already wrapped in my shroud,<br>
my bed is already my tomb.</p>
<p>Something within me is trying to vanish,<br>
someone inside me is trying to leave,<br>
but these are not my remains,<br>
night after night I am living and dying;<br>
my own corpse before me.</p>
<p>I lie on my back and I weep,<br>
I mourn at my own funeral rite,<br>
I am my own undying ghost,<br>
I have roamed through half the graveyard,<br>
each night I return from the pontless journey<br>
, feet soaked by stygian waters.</p>
<p>But Death does not speak like this<br>
from the pages of the upanishads,<br>
there, Death is a mother's welcome<br>
to a child returning from play.</p>
<p>The end is no intermission,<br>
let me leave it once and for all,<br>
I will play for so long before I return,<br>
I will be so tired when I set down my load,<br>
come, let us not regard this world<br>
so darkly, just for a moment,<br>
I have endured this life quietly,<br>
suffering like a dumb beast.</p>
<p>How eager this flower is to fall,<br>
how it longs to cut short the winter day,<br>
to pass in a half-conscious night;<br>
Death returns, defeated,<br>
from the hands of life--<br>
alas, Man does not die.</p>
<p>This is the twentieth century,<br>
death is not easy or hard,<br>
and so my eyes are eager<br>
to open in pale morning light,<br>
to crawl through life's listless day,<br>
a day where no hope has its home.</p>
<p>The new age is lost on its way,<br>
Time comes but makes all newness a void<br>
before it can reach my door,<br>
so Time passes through me as before,<br>
it saddens all those who are happy,<br>
it cheers all those who are sad,<br>
but my indifference is a full stop<br>
to the desires of life:<br>
it strikes all changes dumb.</p>
<p>It is laughable:<br>
as if governed by regular rules,<br>
lizards continue to run to and fro<br>
with regiments of ants<br>
on the four walls of this room:<br>
each plank of the floor is wondering why<br>
this burden upon it never gets up or goes,<br>
it lives, but it is lifeless,<br>
it hardly moves;<br>
this irritation should be thrown out.</p>
<p>A snail can feed without reaching its goal,<br>
but I cannot; so when I am gone,<br>
do not think that anything great is lost;<br>
the warmth of the small space I filled<br>
will simply cool as I grow cold.</p>
<p>Apart of my blanket, the edge of my quilt,<br>
will know that a lightweight existence,<br>
a living helplessness, have fled away;<br>
I shall come to my end before dying,<br>
so many have died, but not ended:<br>
but I wish for no preservation:<br>
although the Himal ever melts at Gangotri,<br>
and never ceases to be,<br>
I must die, and see myself ended.</p>
<p>What claim can I make to be human?<br>
A fistful of weary flesh,<br>
a little bundle of tired bones:<br>
that is all, and what of it?</p>
