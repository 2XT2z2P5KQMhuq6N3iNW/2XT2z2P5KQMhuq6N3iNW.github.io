<p class="ash-poem">My lips smile no more, my heart loses its lightness,<br>
No dream of the future my spirit can cheer;<br>
I only can brood on the past and its brightness,<br>
The dead I have mourned are again living here.<br>
From ev'ry dark nook they press forward to meet me;<br>
I lift up my eyes to the broad leafy dome,<br>
And others are there, looking downward to greet me;<br>
The ash grove, the ash grove alone is my home.<br>

<p class="item-title">Isn't it Grand, Boys</p>
<p class="ash-poem">Look at the coffin, <br>
with golden handles<br>
Isn't it grand, boys, to be bloody-well dead?</p>
<p class="ash-poem">Let's not have a sniffle, <br>
let's have a bloody-good cry <br>
And always remember: The longer you live <br>
The sooner you'll bloody-well die!</p>
<p class="ash-poem">Look at the flowers, <br>
all bloody withered <br>
Isn't it grand, boys, to be bloody-well dead?</p>
<p class="ash-poem">Let's not have a sniffle, <br>
let's have a bloody-good cry <br>
And always remember: The longer you live <br>
The sooner you'll bloody-well die!</p>
<p class="ash-poem">Look at the mourners, <br>
bloody-great hypocrites <br>
Isn't it grand, boys, to be bloody-well dead?</p>
<p class="ash-poem">Let's not have a sniffle, <br>
let's have a bloody-good cry <br>
And always remember: The longer you live <br>
The sooner you'll bloody-well die!</p>
<p class="ash-poem">Look at the preacher, <br>
bloody sanctimonious <br>
Isn't it grand, boys, to be bloody-well dead?</p>
<p class="ash-poem">Let's not have a sniffle, <br>
let's have a bloody-good cry <br>
And always remember: The longer you live <br>
The sooner you'll bloody-well die!</p>
<p class="ash-poem">Look at the widow, <br>
bloody-great female <br>
Isn't it grand, boys, to be bloody-well dead?</p>

let's have a bloody-good cry <br>

<p class="item-title">Scarborough Fair</p>
<p class="ash-poem">Are you going to Scarborough Fair?<br>
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme,<br>
Remember me to one who lives there,<br>
For once she was a true love of mine.</p>
<p class="ash-poem">Have her make me a cambric shirt,<br>
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme,<br>
Without a seam or fine needle work,<br>
And then she'll be a true love of mine.</p>
<p class="ash-poem">Have her wash it in yonder dry well,<br>
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme,<br>
Where ne'er a drop of water e'er fell,<br>
And then she'll be a true love of mine.</p>
<p class="ash-poem">Have her find me an acre of land<br>
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme,<br>
Between the sea and over the sand,<br>
And then she'll be a true love of mine.</p>
<p class="ash-poem">Plow the land with the horn of a lamb<br>
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme,<br>
Then sow some seeds from north of the dam<br>
And then she'll be a true love of mine.</p>
<p class="ash-poem">If she tells me she can't, I'll reply<br>
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme,<br>
Let me know that at least she will try<br>
And then she'll be a true love of mine.</p>
<p class="ash-poem">Love imposes impossible tasks,<br>
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme,<br>
Though not more than any heart asks<br>
And I must know she's a true love of mine.</p>
<p class="ash-poem">Dear, when thou has finished thy task,<br>
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme,<br>
Come to me, my hand for to ask,<br>
For thou then art a true love of mine.</p>
