<P>
<A NAME="I-section-1."><H2>1)  What is a.s.h about?</H2></A>

<P>
<A NAME="I-section-1.1."><H3>1.1)  What is a.s.h? </H3></A>

<P>
 a.s.h (or ash) is the common abbreviation for the usenet newsgroup
 <A HREF="http://www.deja.com/group/alt.suicide.holiday">alt.suicide.holiday</A>. A.s.h is an unmoderated newsgroup which was set
 up in late 1987/early 1988 to discuss why suicides increase during
 the holiday seasons; this topic however, quickly ran thin. Currently,
 common topics on ash include poetry, philosophy, psychology,
 relationships, depression, and of course...  suicide.

<P>
 Because of the wide range of topics, we define ash as follows:

<P>
   The ash newsgroup is the "home" of the ash subculture. Any topic can
   be discussed as long as it is in the spirit of the ash subculture.


<P>
<A NAME="I-section-1.2."><H3>1.2)  What is the a.s.h subculture? </H3></A>

<P>
 A culture is a set of values, norms, ideas and patterns of behavior
 which are shared by all members of a society. A subculture is the
 culture of a group which is part of the surrounding society.

<P>
 Sociologists distinguish between two kinds of subcultures according
 to the way in which they differ from the surrounding culture<A HREF="FAQGuides.html#I-REF-1">[1]</A>.  A
 <EM>norm</EM> oriented subculture accepts most values of society, but in
 some areas has different norms, i.e. different ways of acting and
 behaving.  A <EM>value</EM> oriented subculture does not accept some of the
 basic values of society. To be more precise it does not accept the
 order of precedence that society has set for certain values.

<P>
 The ash subculture has different <EM>values</EM> than the rest of
 society. Society attributes the highest value to human life. In
 contrast, we think that the value of individual freedom is superior
 to the value of life, when it does not physically interfere with
 another's freedom.  This includes the individual freedom to take
 one's own life if desired. Note that we value life as well, we only
 disagree with society on the "order" of importance of these values.

<P>
 In short, we believe that, in general, people have a right to commit
 suicide.

<P>
 Most newsgroups are home to norm oriented subcultures which are more
 easily defined by topic - the norm is to talk much more about that
 specific topic. Value oriented subcultures are more difficult to
 define by topic because people with different values have a different
 view of life. Discussion on the group can be almost about anything,
 but "through" this view, through this different way of looking at the
 world.

<P>
 Note: although the ash subculture started out in the ash newsgroup,
 they are separate entities. For example, the ash subculture can
 continue its existence without the ash newsgroup, by migrating to
 other online forums.


<P>
<A NAME="I-section-1.3."><H3>1.3)  Who is an asher?</H3></A>

<P>
 Usually, the term "asher" is used in conversation to describe a
 reader of ash who is suicidal or at least depressed, i.e., the
 stereotypical asher.

<P>
 However, for the purpose of defining who is and who is not an asher,
 we provide a more "formal" definition.

<P>
 Formally, an asher is somebody who is aware of the existence of the
 ash subculture and shares its values.

<P>
 One doesn't have to be suicidal or even depressed in order to be an
 asher. Also, an asher doesn't have to read or post to ash. Similarly,
 posting to ash doesn't automatically make one an asher.

<P>
 In short, an asher is a member of the ash subculture.
 

<P>
<A NAME="I-section-1.4."><H3>1.4)  Does ash encourage suicide? </H3></A>

<P>
 The ash subculture does not encourage suicide, i.e., we do not
 persuade people to commit suicide.

<P>
 However, we believe that people have a right to commit suicide and
 thus, in general, do not try to dissuade people from doing so.

<P>
 This attitude combined with other content which appears on the group
 may cause some to believe that we are promoting suicide, but what we
 are promoting is merely the right to <EM>choose</EM> to commit suicide.

<P>
 This is analogous to abortion rights activists, who are not seen as
 "encouraging abortions" but as enabling women to choose abortion.


<P>
<A NAME="I-section-1.5."><H3>1.5)  Is ash pro-suicide or pro-choice? </H3></A>

<P>
 As mentioned before, we believe people have a right to choose to
 commit suicide. Some ashers will call this position
 "pro-suicide". What they mean is that ash is pro <EM>legitimizing</EM>
 suicide, or pro <EM>legalizing</EM> suicide. However, "pro-suicide" can
 easily be misunderstood as promoting or encouraging suicide.

<P>
 We recommend to state our position as "pro-choice". 

<P>
 Although it could be mixed up with pro-choice for abortion rights,
 the meaning is usually clear from the context. If you fear you could
 be misunderstood you can use "pro-choice-suicide" or
 "pro-choice-abortion" to clear things up.


<P>
<A NAME="I-section-1.6."><H3>1.6)  Is ash a support group?</H3></A>

<P>
 Ash is <EM>not</EM> a <EM>conventional</EM> support group for suicidal people,
 where the focus is mainly on prevention.  If you are seeking for a
 forum aimed at supporting people not to commit suicide, or a forum
 with the purpose of eliminating suicidal feelings then ash is the
 wrong place for you. If you are searching for such an online forum,
 see <A HREF="FAQGuides.html#I-section-4.1">Section 4.1</A>, on related newsgroups.

<P>
 This does not mean that ash is not a support group in general, but to
 determine whether ash is or is not one we have to define what a support
 group is. We use the following definition:

<P>
 A <EM>support group</EM> is a group which consists mostly or exclusively of
 peers facing the same problem or situation.  A support group may help
 by providing advice, but more importantly, it gives participants a
 sense of comfort, understanding, and relief which comes from talking
 to people in a similar situation.

<P>
 The purpose of a support group is not necessarily to cure or change the
 situation: in some cases it is not even possible (e.g. chronic disease)
 and in others undesirable (e.g. support group for single mothers).

<P>
 An example for a support group with some similarity to ash is
 <A HREF="http://www.deja.com/group/soc.support.fat-acceptance">soc.support.fat-acceptance</A>, in which pushing people toward the
 conventional accepted goal for fat people, namely weight loss, is 
 specifically inappropriate.

<P>
 So ash could be viewed as a worldwide support platform where people
 can rant, receive advice or simply talk, with little fear of attack
 for feeling suicidal.

<P>
 Ash allows many of us to acknowledge our feelings and deal with them
 better than conventional approaches which we have found to be
 useless, self-delusional and even harmful. The conventional approach
 to suicidal tendencies focuses on eliminating them rather than
 dealing with them, but this is not always possible.


<P>
<A NAME="I-section-1.7."><H3>1.7)  What is ash good for?</H3></A>

<P>
 Albert Camus wrote that, "Suicide is prepared within the silence of
 the heart, as is a great work of art". Psychologists, and common
 sense, agree that talking freely about feelings of suicide, bringing
 suicidal thoughts out of the "silence of the heart", is a good thing,
 and can ease the sense of alienation <A HREF="FAQGuides.html#I-REF-13">[13]</A><A HREF="FAQGuides.html#I-REF-15">[15]</A><A HREF="FAQGuides.html#I-REF-16">[16]</A> that often
 contributes to suicidal thoughts. <A HREF="FAQGuides.html#I-REF-2">[2]</A>

<P>
 There is no evidence that open discussion of suicide increases the
 risk of suicide.<A HREF="FAQGuides.html#I-REF-3">[3]</A>

<P>
 But it is often difficult to talk openly about suicide in a culture
 that regards suicide as a taboo.  Traditional support newsgroups
 reinforce that taboo by relentlessly insisting that suicide is wrong.
 Messages that attempt to delegitimize suicide by describing the act
 as sinful, shameful, or selfish can have the effect of making the
 person who feels suicidal feel abused and humiliated.  Not only does
 this, in many instances, fail to counter suicidal thoughts, but such
 feelings of humiliation are recognized as being a very common
 triggering factor in suicides and suicide attempts.<A HREF="FAQGuides.html#I-REF-4">[4]</A>

<P>
 Traditional support newsgroups often attempt to delegitimize suicide
 by offering a "positive" view of life, "like a lighted window in a
 winter storm," as one author put it.<A HREF="FAQGuides.html#I-REF-5">[5]</A> But to the person viewing
 that life from outside, it only acts to emphasize the distinction
 between the warm ideal of life and the person's own cold despair.

<P>
 The effect, then, of the approach of delegitimizing suicide is to
 further alienate the suicidal and discourage them from participating
 in traditional support newsgroups, to force the suicidal feelings
 back into "the silence of the heart" <A HREF="FAQGuides.html#I-REF-8">[8]</A><A HREF="FAQGuides.html#I-REF-9">[9]</A>.  So, while the kind of
 talk taking place in a.s.h. probably isn't what most psychotherapists
 have in mind as "support therapy", the basic a.s.h. premise of
 accepting suicide as a valid option encourages people to talk freely
 about suicide <A HREF="FAQGuides.html#I-REF-11">[11]</A><A HREF="FAQGuides.html#I-REF-12">[12]</A><A HREF="FAQGuides.html#I-REF-16">[16]</A>.  These people might otherwise feel they
 had no place to express those thoughts.  In fact, many ashers report
 that participating in a.s.h. makes them feel better <A HREF="FAQGuides.html#I-REF-10">[10]</A><A HREF="FAQGuides.html#I-REF-11">[11]</A>, and
 eases their urges to act on their suicidal thoughts <A HREF="FAQGuides.html#I-REF-14">[14]</A><A HREF="FAQGuides.html#I-REF-15">[15]</A>. And
 that may in fact cause a reduction in the number of suicides - even
 though that is not the object of the newsgroup.

<HR>

<P>
<A NAME="I-section-2."><H2>2)  Posting guidelines.</H2></A>

<P>
 Please behave respectfully and civilized during your presence on
 ash. Just because we disagree does not mean we have to call each
 other names.

<P>
 Anything that is regarded as bad netiquette, such as spamming,
 commercial advertising and excessive crossposting is not
 welcome. Read any introductory document about Usenet/Internet for
 info on this sort of posts, for example,
 <A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/usenet-i/usenet-help.html">http://sunsite.unc.edu/usenet-i/usenet-help.html</A> or
 <A HREF="http://sunsite.auc.dk/RFC/rfc/rfc1855.html.">http://sunsite.auc.dk/RFC/rfc/rfc1855.html.</A>

<P>
 Also, please read the points mentioned below very carefully. If you
 are uncertain as to whether or not your post is appropriate, then
 keep in mind that the best judge for this is ash itself. But this
 involves risking getting flamed by the entire population for not
 adhering to the ash guidelines ...


<P>
<A NAME="I-section-2.1."><H3>2.1)  Anti-choice posts</H3></A>

<P>
 The regular posters on ash see suicide as a valid option. They are
 not interested in reading anti-suicide or pro-suicide messages, both
 of which are seen as denying the right to choose.

<P>
 Anti-choice postings are not proper netiquette, since they are
 off-topic for ash.  It is <EM>not</EM> proper netiquette to invade a group
 with postings that oppose the nature of the group. (Like it is not
 welcome to go to a 'real-life' alcohol-dependency support group and
 shout 'you should all just grow up').


<P>
<A NAME="I-section-2.2."><H3>2.2)  Anti-suicide posts</H3></A>

<P>
 Anti-suicide posts are usually counterproductive.  Some of the
 readers are having a hard enough time in life without being
 confronted with stuff they do not want to hear. They have little
 energy to deal with this, as they need all their energy to go on
 living.
 
<P>
 We feel alienated from society because of the views it tries to
 impose on us. Ash is the only place where we feel safe, and can
 discuss issues freely.  Anti-suicide posts reinforce our alienation
 from society, as such posts forcefully intrude into our only
 sanctuary.  Instead of allowing us to get the kind of support and
 understanding some of us need in order to survive another day,
 anti-suicide posts corner us into defending our views.
 
<P>
 Being told over and over again that they are wrong to decide in favor
 of suicide might be so hurtful to suicidal people that it pushes them
 over the edge, causing them to commit suicide sooner.  To those
 people, you would be the catalyst in the process that you want to
 stop.

<P>
 In general, discussing why you think suicide is not an option for 
 <EM>yourself</EM> is acceptable, but you should <EM>not</EM> tell others not to do so, 
 or make broad denials of the validity of suicide as an option for 
 others.  You are welcome to join our discussions, as long as you respect 
 the basic premise of ash, that suicide is a legitimate choice. Also note
 the following guidelines:

<OL>
  <LI>Don't post arguments that have been dealt with countless times
    already by the newsgroup.  The people on ash have witnessed many
    posts by people who insist suicide is a bad idea.  Many of the
    most-frequently recited arguments have been collected and answered
    in the Debate faq, which newcomers should read at:
    <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/2150/std.html">http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/2150/std.html</A> . Repeating
    trite assertions that have been argued and answered already will
    only serve to annoy the readers of ash and reinforce the idea that
    the anti-suicide poster is fundamentally disrespectful of the
    readers and the group's nature.

  <LI>Do not make unsubstantiated or unsubstantiatable claims.  Probably
    the most common, and most insulting, unsupportable assertion is a
    general prediction about how suicidal people the poster has never
    even met will feel at some vague time in the future.  Illogical
    arguments, and those that don't go beyond saying that the poster's
    emotional position is "right" and different feelings are "wrong"
    just make for pointless discussions.  For information on logical argumentation, check out
    <A HREF="http://www.infidels.org/news/atheism/logic.html">http://www.infidels.org/news/atheism/logic.html</A> .

  <LI>Don't preach. A preacher is someone who, during relentless
    attempts to persuade others, ignores, unjustly dismisses, or uses
    fallacious reasoning to counter the arguments of
    others. Preachers seem to be standing on a podium, unwilling to
    engage in any dialog.

  <LI>Avoid religious argumentation, for example, that people who commit
    suicide go to hell, or that suicide is wrong simply because it
    says so in the Bible (or any other scripture). Many ashers
    consider themselves atheists, so your posts will offend rather
    than convince.  Offended people will rarely be willing to
    seriously listen to anything you might have to say.  Those who are
    offended usually start posting anti-religious posts, which in turn
    could weaken the belief of those ashers that are religious. That
    very belief may be the only thing that stops them from committing
    suicide.
    Furthermore, those ashers that are of the same religion as you
    already know what your religion thinks of suicide. They have
    either accepted that view (and are still suicidal) or have come
    to the conclusion that the religion is wrong. Should you disagree
    on this, it will be a religious disagreement, which should be
    taken to the appropriate newsgroup.


</OL>
<P>
<A NAME="I-section-2.3."><H3>2.3)  Pro-suicide posts </H3></A>

<P>
 Pro-suicide posts, urging people to commit suicide, are also
 inappropriate. Apart from being stupid and distasteful they also
 cause people to feel unsafe to post.

<P>
 It is not clear why such posts appear sometimes on ash and what kind
 of people post them. But we guess they are of one of the following
 groups:

<OL>
  <LI>People who are using reverse psychology. These people actually
    don't want us to commit suicide. However, they don't believe we are
    serious.  Instead they think we are just seeking for attention, so
    their reaction is something like "go kill yourself already" to
    make a point that our attempts of getting attention are not
    working. The problem with these people is that they don't
    understand that we are not looking for attention (also see <A HREF="FAQGuides.html#I-REF-6">[6]</A>).
 
  <LI>People encouraging suicide for an external cause such as religion,
    politics, the environment (CoE), etc. Usually, these people are not
    ashers; ashers tend to emphasize the individual, his importance,
    desires and authority.  Holding other entities, such as god,
    country, or earth as more important than the individual implies 
    that we should follow an external, imposed agenda - denying the 
    individual the right to choose.
 
  <LI>Mean perverted trolls whose goal is to make trouble.

</OL>
<P>
 Anyway, people who post pro-suicide posts are not ashers in the sense
 defined above.


<P>
<A NAME="I-section-2.4."><H3>2.4)  Is it OK to try to help ashers in a conventional sense?</H3></A>

<P>
 In general, unless they specifically request for it, ashers are not
 seeking for conventional life-affirming advice on ash. There are many
 other forums for that.  Most ashers are familiar with such advice
 since they have heard it numerous times. Repeating such advice not
 only annoys ashers, but also insults their intelligence.

<P>
 Still, in some cases such help is welcome: if there is reason to
 believe that the person has not thought things through (for example,
 a recent breakup with girlfriend), or if there is reason to believe
 that the person is misinformed (for example, if there is a new
 treatment for their otherwise terminal disease).

<P>
 However, a lot also depends on who is dispensing such advice.  Advice
 from an asher would carry much weight in the eyes of the group and
 the person to which the advice is given. Ashers are able to take the
 specific circumstances of an individual into account and assess
 whether conventional advice has any merit or novelty.

<P>
 Non-ashers are not capable of this. Regardless to the situation they
 always dispense pro-life advice, since their motivation is to keep
 people alive. Therefore, their advice cannot be trusted.

<P>
 Of course, <EM>sometimes</EM> even non-ashers give good advice. This may
 even be identical to some advice given by an asher.  However, even a
 broken clock is correct twice a day, yet it is not something you
 would rely upon or keep hanging on the wall. Non-ashers, similar to a
 broken clock, <EM>always</EM> provide the same biased advice, and this is
 why it is not welcome.

 
<P>
<A NAME="I-section-2.5."><H3>2.5)  Is it OK to talk about happy events in one's life?</H3></A>

<P>
 This depends on whether you are an asher or not. If out the blue, a
 newcomer posts about how wonderful life is, this will not be well
 received. It is not obvious how it relates to ash and is of little
 interest to ashers. Some ashers might view this as a covert, pro-life
 attempt to "cheer people up".

<P>
 However, if happy events occur to somebody who is known as an asher,
 then such posts are most welcome. Ashers are interested to know what
 happens to people they care about, and they are glad when good things
 happen to other ashers.


<HR>

<P>
<A NAME="I-section-3."><H2>3)  Reading/posting to ash.</H2></A>

<P>
<A NAME="I-section-3.1."><H3>3.1)  Are there other ways to read/post to a.s.h?</H3></A>
<P>
 The particular news server you are using may have a poor newsfeed.
 Some news servers lose messages or expire them too quickly for you to
 read. Others take a lot of time to receive posts from other
 sites. Furthermore, some news servers don't even carry ash.  For these
 reasons you may want to read ash using other means.

<P>
 Uzi Paz's document on Usenet access is an excellent resource on doing
 just that. It also covers numerous other aspects of Usenet.  It can
 be found at:

<A NAME="I-section-3.2."><H3>3.2)  The dangers of posting to ash.</H3></A>

<P>
 There are two main sources of danger from posting to ash.  

<P>
 In the short term somebody may act upon something you posted. Anybody
 can be lurking out there. On top of this, if you are posting from
 work or university the system administrator might be reading your
 posts. Many people are against suicide and will try to intervene.

<P>
 The risk is increased if your posts indicate you are actually going
 to commit suicide in the near future. For example, if you post a
 suicide note or announce a date or place where you will commit
 suicide.

<P>
 Your university, internet service provider or local police department
 may be contacted; the outcome may vary from embarrassment to
 hospitalization <A HREF="FAQGuides.html#I-REF-7">[7]</A>. For example, college friends of one poster found
 out about her posts.  The college got involved in what developed into
 quite an embarrassing situation...

<P>
 Even if you are not posting under your real identity chances are that
 you can be tracked down since most service providers will reveal your
 identity if they are informed you are about to commit suicide.

<P>
 As for long term dangers, some machines archive usenet posts. The
 most well known of them is dejanews. This machine archives all posts
 (except ones which contain an explicit request not to be archived).

<P>
 Anyone can then search dejanews for all the articles you posted in
 the past.  This could be an employer trying to check you out before
 hiring you. Friends or family.


<P>
<A NAME="I-section-3.3."><H3>3.3)  Protecting yourself.</H3></A>

<P>
 Unless you are absolutely sure that it is impossible to track you
 down, it is important not to give any indication about plans to
 commit suicide. Do not post suicide notes. Do not post the time or
 place in which you intend to commit suicide. Do not carry a
 "countdown" of the time left till you die. Such posts are an
 invitation to intervene.

<P>
<A NAME="I-section-3.3.1."><H4>3.3.1)  How do I post anonymously?</H4></A>

<P>
 With e-mail, unless you are a hacker, your name and site are sent
 along with your mail.  However, some sites allow you to 'remove' your
 identity from the mail.  You send your mail, with instructions on
 where it is to be sent to a 'remailer' which then strips your name
 off the mail, and sends it to its destination with a new 'anonymous'
 identity.

<P>
 This article offers a nontechnical overview of remailers:
 <A HREF="http://www.well.com/user/abacard/remail.html">http://www.well.com/user/abacard/remail.html</A> 

<P>
 And some more links:

 <A HREF="http://www.stack.nl/~galactus/remailers/">http://www.stack.nl/~galactus/remailers/</A>

<P>
 Setting up for usage of an anonymous remailer is a hassle, but that
 is the only negative aspect. Nobody will mind you using an anonymous
 name on ash.

<P>
 Not everybody on ash really has a reason to go anonymous, but you
 should try to query dejanews for all the articles you have posted.
 It might give you quite a scare.

<P>
<A NAME="I-section-3.3.2."><H4>3.3.2)  How do I prevent my message from being archived? </H4></A>

<P>
 If you do not want news archivers like Deja News to archive your
 message (i.e. if you do not want your message in their database), please
 add the header

<P>
 x-no-archive: yes

<P>
 to the headers of your post. This will also be recognized if this
 string occurs alone as the first line in the body of your message
 (use this method if you do not know how to add headers to your post.)

<P>
 This will not prevent your messages from being archived if they are
 copied or referenced in a reply to your message. Furthermore, not all
 news archivers have to respect this header.

<P>

<A NAME="I-section-4."><H2>4)  Other resources </H2></A>

<P>
<A NAME="I-section-4.1."><H3>4.1)  Related newsgroups.</H3></A>

<P>
 There are several newsgroups which are related to suicide:
 <A HREF="http://www.deja.com/group/alt.suicide">alt.suicide</A>, <A HREF="http://www.deja.com/group/alt.suicide.methods">alt.suicide.methods</A>, <A HREF="http://www.deja.com/group/alt.suicide.finals">alt.suicide.finals</A>, and
 <A HREF="http://www.deja.com/group/alc.suicide">alc.suicide</A>.  Of these, <A HREF="http://www.deja.com/group/alt.suicide.methods">alt.suicide.methods</A> is the most relevant to
 a.s.h., as it discusses suicide methods.  However, these newsgroups
 are carried by fewer news servers and have relatively little traffic.
 
<P>
 There are also numerous traditional support groups for people dealing
 with suicidal feelings, including: <A HREF="http://www.deja.com/group/alt.support.grief">alt.support.grief</A>,
 <A HREF="http://www.deja.com/group/alt.support.grief.suicide">alt.support.grief.suicide</A>, and <A HREF="http://www.deja.com/group/soc.support.depression.crisis">soc.support.depression.crisis</A>.
 
<P>
 The <A HREF="http://www.deja.com/group/alt.support.depression">alt.support.depression</A> (a.s.d) newsgroup is a traditional support
 newsgroup with a great deal of traffic.  As suicide is often
 associated to depression, many people read both a.s.h and a.s.d .
 
<P>
 However, a.s.d.  has a very conventional response to suicide,
 strongly opposing suicide as a valid option and urging intervention
 to prevent suicides, according to the a.s.d faq:
 <A HREF="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/alt-support-depression/faq/part1/">http://www.faqs.org/faqs/alt-support-depression/faq/part1/</A>

<P>
 Because of the very different premises of a.s.d. and a.s.h. regarding
 the legitimacy of suicide, it is strongly urged that people not
 crosspost messages between the two newsgroups. Such crossposts
 often generate long flamewars and seldom provide any useful posts.

<P>
 There are also numerous support newsgroups and online resources
 dedicated to specific circumstances that may be involved in suicidal
 feelings, such as depression, loneliness, grief, particular
 disorders, etc..  Comprehensive listings of these newsgroups can be
 found at <A HREF="http://psychcentral.com/resources/">http://psychcentral.com/resources/</A> .

<P>
<A NAME="I-section-4.2."><H3>4.2)  Mailing lists.</H3></A>

<P>
 There are two mailing lists related to ash. These have a much better
 signal-to-noise ratio than ash.

 This section is part 2 of the alt.suicide.holiday FAQ, co-authored

<H1><A NAME="II-section-2.">Introduction</A></H1>

<P>
 Ash culture is a fluctuating thing. Like any Usenet newsgroup it
 varies from week to week and with who is participating at any one
 time. Furthermore, it is many things to many people.

<P>
 A document trying to describe the ash subculture cannot avoid
 generalizations. Indeed, we do not claim it is accurate. However we
 hope this document may prove to be useful, especially for newcomers
 to ash, to obtain an initial idea of how ashers think, feel, talk and
 behave.

<P>
 Note that at any given time, any forum related to ash may have non
 ashers participating in the discussion. This article talks only 
 about ashers.

<H2><A NAME="II-section-2.1.">1) Suicide</A></H2>

<P>
 Ashers do not think suicide is immoral, irrational, or selfish.  For
 further information about our views on these topics please read the
 "ash FAQ - Suicide The Debate".


<H3><A NAME="II-section-2.1.1.">1.1) Is suicide good or bad?</A></H3>
 
<P>
 A newcomer to ash may think that since most of society believes that
 suicide is bad, and we disagree with society, then it must be that we
 believe that suicide is good. But this is not the case.

<P>
 In most societies, the common belief is that suicide is bad in
 general. The ash subculture believes that suicide may be a good option
 at least for <EM>some</EM> people. Therefore, the faq "is suicide good or bad" 
 is misleading, since for each individual the answer may be different.

<P>
 However, in contrast with the dominant culture, we do not presume to
 know what the answer is for each person. This is one of the reasons
 why we are pro-choice.


<H3><A NAME="II-section-2.1.2.">1.2) Is suicide a right?</A></H3>

<P>
 It is important to distinguish between a <EM>legal</EM> right and a <EM>moral</EM>
 right. Depending on the laws of your country, suicide may or may not
 be a legal right. But the question of the legality of suicide is not
 of much interest to ashers.

<P>
 As for whether suicide is a moral right, we think it is. This is
 our main disagreement with society.


<H3><A NAME="II-section-2.1.3.">1.3) A right for whom?</A></H3>
   
<P>
 The common opinion on ash is that suicide should be a right for all,
 with the exception of children, and adults who are not responsible
 for themselves.  However, there are may variations and divergence
 from this view.

<P>
 In one extreme, some believe that children should have this right as
 well.  However, there is usually some age below which they agree that
 suicide should not be a right. It seems that the real issue here is
 disagreement about the definition of a child/adult. It is obvious
 that current definitions which uses arbitrary age limits are
 inaccurate, however they are easy to use and clear-cut.

<P>
 On the other side of the spectrum, some believe that the right to
 suicide is superseded in the case of other existing moral or legal
 obligations, such as having young children which require care, or
 even having pending financial obligations.

<HR>
 
<H2><A NAME="II-section-2.2.">2) How ashers react to various situations</A></H2>


<H3><A NAME="II-section-2.2.1.">2.1) When newcomers arrive, or old-timers return</A></H3>

<P>
 Sometimes someone who posted a farewell message returns later to inform us
 s/he failed the attempt. Or decided not to go through with it at the last
 moment. Other people leave ash because they want to go on with their lives
 without the presence of ash, to return later because they found out they
 still needed ash in their lives.

<P>
 Those that remained behind on ash sometimes experience opposite
 emotions about these returns. Whenever you know somebody is in pain
 and really wants to die, one feels saddened for that person if it did
 not work out the way it was supposed to. At the same time, a lot of
 ashers feel ashamed for being glad that this person is back. Glad
 because of their presence, ashamed because we basically get something
 positive out of this persons misery.

<P>
 These opposing emotions are the origin of the customary ash welcome:
 "Welcome to ash, sorry you're here."

<P>
 Our true wish is that ash would be empty, but not because the former
 readers would have committed suicide. We wish that all ashers find
 happiness and contentment, however we know this is not always
 possible. Due to our altruistic desire for ashers to have better lives,
 some ashers find it difficult to admit that they are selfishly happy
 when someone returns to ash. However, ashers understand this conflict -
 nobody has every been offended by being welcomed back.


<H3><A NAME="II-section-2.2.2.">2.2) When an asher commits suicide</A></H3>

<P>
 Whenever an account of suicide by an asher reaches the group, those
 staying behind deal with their own emotions. We understand that
 suicide was probably the best option available to this person. We respect
 this decision, we are glad that they have finally managed to
 escape their pain.

<P>
 At the same time we are often saddened. After all, this is a person we
 have come to know, often even come to like. Because of their presence,
 they added something to our lives. A nice remark, an insightful post, a
 good joke, everybody has something to add to our subculture. And
 because they added some extra flavor to our lives, they made our lives
 just a bit more bearable. Because of this, we feel sad to see one of us
 leave.


<H3><A NAME="II-section-2.2.3.">2.3) When an asher who attempted suicide returns to ash</A></H3>

<P>
 Ashers understand the difficulties of committing suicide, and are
 sympathetic of people who have attempted. 
 
<P>
 Some ashers who have attempted suicide, feared they might be
 ridiculed for their unsuccessful attempts. Many feel ashamed having
 failed in death on top of their perceived failure in life and were
 afraid to return to the group.
 
<P>
 However, it is precisely at such times where ash can help most. As
 alienation from family and friends can increase after a suicide
 attempt, ash may be the best outlet to talk things over. On top
 of this discussion about unsuccessful attempts is usually of great
 interest to other ashers as it provides information on what does and
 does not work.
 
<H3><A NAME="II-section-2.2.4.">2.4) Why didn't I get a reply?</A></H3>

<P>
 When someone makes a post, sometimes there are no follow-up posts and the reasons for this vary:

<UL>
  <LI>Sometimes it's not entirely clear that the poster wants a reply.
   If you want replies, say so.

  <LI>Ashers are mostly depressed and may not have the energy to reply.

  <LI>Often, people just don't know what to say.  

  <LI>Distractions on the newsgroup (e.g. , a flamewar).
 
  <LI>Keep in mind that this is Usenet and your post may not
   have even reached all of the news servers.
 
</UL>
<P>
 The main thing is to not take no replies (especially to a first post) 
 personally. If you don't get a response and want one then it's OK to ask
 (nicely) again. 

<HR>

<H2><A NAME="II-section-2.3.">3) Attitude to outsiders</A></H2>

<P>
 The key to understanding our relationship with other groups is the
 concept of social control.  Social control includes any process or
 mechanism which is designed to achieve conformity. The goal of social
 control is to ensure that members of society behave appropriately
 <A HREF="FAQGuides.html#II-REF-1">[1]</A>.

<P>
 Involuntary treatment is a form of <EM>formal</EM> social control which
 ashers might have to deal with. In this case some formal institution
 or authority attempts to force conformity.

<P>
 <EM>Informal</EM> social control, on the other hand, is much more common.
 It takes place during normal, everyday interaction in the form of
 negative responses.  An example of informal social control on ash is
 posters who try to persuade ashers that suicide is immoral.
 
<P>
 In this section we describe how ashers relate to other groups either
 online or in real life.  Groups who tend to apply more social control
 on ashers are usually those who are disliked the most.  The section
 is roughly organized such that groups which appear later apply
 increasing degrees of social control to ash and ashers.


<H3><A NAME="II-section-2.3.1.">3.1) Friends of people who committed suicide</A></H3>

<P>
 As long as they acknowledge our values and do not try to "help"
 us, there are tolerated.
 
<P>
 In fact, participation of such people in our discussions can help
 both sides. They can gain better understanding of suicidal people
 and learn to accept the suicide as a valid option. In turn, ashers
 can learn what pain suicide leaves on those left behind, and although
 such pain is not an overriding reason to denounce suicide, it is a 
 factor which can be taken into account if so desired.


<H3><A NAME="II-section-2.3.2.">3.2) alt.support.depression</A></H3>

<P>
 The existence of ash and alt.support.depression (asd) is proof to
 how differently people can express suffering and pain.  Though each
 group's membership consists of people who are in enough emotional
 pain that they are considering ending their lives, the
 environment of each group is vastly different and in a way they
 are almost opposites.  In ash, people can make choices about what
 they wish to do with their lives (be it change it, continue it,
 or end it.)  Asd is more of a traditional suicide support group whose
 goal is to help its members find reasons to continue their lives and
 to find solutions to the problems they face.  Both try to offer a
 safe supportive environment for their members.  Since both are
 unmoderated Usenet newsgroups the success of this varies.

<P>
 Ashers are happy to give their experience when asked, but you have to
 ask.  Asd assumes that you want to feel better and that you desire
 their advice, opinions, support and e-hugs (which they express by
 putting your name inside of brackets {{{{{name}}}}}}, something you
 should not do on ash.)

<P>
 On ash, you are perfectly free post "I want to die" and generally no
 one is going be say "No, you don't."  More likely, the replies will
 be along the lines of "Yes, I feel that way too and it's hell."  On
 the other hand, posting the same thing on asd will often get replies
 like "Yes, you may feel that way now, but the feeling will pass, and
 in some time period it will feel different."  Asd assumes that you
 want to be talked out of suicidal tendencies, ash does not.

<P>
 Given that the two groups are so fundamentally different, please
 never crosspost between the two, no matter how appropriate it may
 seem.  Instead, ask both groups separately and you will get some very
 different and potentially useful opinions from both.  Crossposting
 usually causes horrible flame wars and your question will go
 unanswered. The members of each group often do not really understand
 the mindset of the other, so a flame war between the two can cause
 serious psychological damage (which can be quite dangerous).  These
 groups are sometimes the only support that some of the participants
 have and when that support is disrupted by a flame war, then some
 folks may choose to take their lives sooner than they would have if
 that support had been there.  This may sound trite, but this is not a
 game we're all playing.  Agree with it or not, some people do live
 and die by these groups and it's important to respect that.

<P>
 A note to ashers. Some ashers dislike and ridicule online forums like
 asd, that provide a more traditional forms of support, as useless and
 requiring insincere displays of affection. This view is quite
 subjective. The support on asd suits those who read it, and not
 ashers. In fact the number of participants in asd substantially
 outnumbers those in ash.  In short, don't put asd down. Many people
 find it useful.


<H3><A NAME="II-section-2.3.3.">3.3) Psychologists and psychiatrists</A></H3>

<P>
 Our relation with mental health professionals is ambivalent at best.
 They may be helpful in many cases. However, there are also some
 serious problems.

<P>
 Psychologists and psychiatrists are not magicians. They cannot solve
 all problems. Furthermore, like any profession, some of them are good
 and some are not. Many ashers have had bad experiences from
 traditional therapy - long yet unhelpful treatment, long lasting side
 affects from psychiatric drugs or being put into a mental institution
 against one's will. However, the reason for these experiences may be
 just that their particular doctors were lacking.
 
<P>
 The real problems are more fundamental. The mental health
 establishment and us have different value systems that are difficult
 to reconcile. Our differences are simply a reflection of our
 disagreement with society in general. A society which does not
 acknowledge the right to commit suicide.

<P>
 Mental health establishments attitudes are based on current
 laws/government, which, in turn, are reflections of the current
 society's values. To be licensed as a therapist you have to agree to
 uphold a code of conduct. Furthermore, mental health practitioners
 belong to a professional association and are obligated to adhere to a
 code of ethics as a condition of membership. The code is a statement
 of standards of conduct towards clients and others.  In most cases,
 the law sets only minimum standards of conduct. Ethics demands
 more. This is especially true in regard to suicidal individuals.

<P>
 The attitude of mental health practitioners in your area depends
 largely on the legislation in you country and the codes of ethics of
 the professional associations with which they are affiliated. But 
 most of all it depends on the individual beliefs of values of the
 therapist.

<P>
 From the point of view of ashers, mental health practitioners are
 agents of social control. This does not that there are not some
 therapists who are understanding and may acknowledge the right to
 suicide in some cases, but legal and ethical codes make finding such
 therapists a difficult task.

<P>
 The use of psychology as a device for social control is not new -
 runaway slaves and homosexuality in America, masturbation in England
 and political dissidence in the Soviet Union have all been classified
 as mental illness in the past, and thus exposed to enforce
 treatment<A HREF="FAQGuides.html#II-REF-1">[1]</A>.  Such treatment can be as coercive as any other form of
 social control.

<P>
 For therapy to succeed the doctor and patient must establish a
 relationship of trust. This allows the patient to be open and discuss
 anything which may help in the process of therapy.  The patient
 trusts the doctor to do everything possible for the patient's best
 interest. However, ashers face serious obstacles in establishing
 trust with their doctors.

<P>
 Ashers consider suicide to be a valid option. The mental health
 establishment rejects this. Note that an essential prerequisite
 for making a rational decision is that all reasonable options 
 be taken into account. Therefore, from an asher's point of view,
 just by entering the mental health system, the asher compromises
 his ability to exercise a rational decision process.
 
<P>
 To exemplify this, consider the following scenario: after many years
 of treatment, the doctor of an asher concludes that the situation is
 hopeless - there is nothing the doctor can do to help the asher out
 of depression. The asher could have used this information to make a
 rational choice: if life in the current situation is unbearable then
 suicide may be considered, otherwise it may still be possible to
 continue on living despite depression.

<P>
 But the doctor has reasons not to disclose this information.  Many
 doctors simply accept the values of society - for them suicide is
 indeed unthinkable. However, even if the therapist realizes that
 suicide might be a reasonable option for a patient, there are
 external forces at work.

<P>
 The suicide of a patient is considered in the eyes of relatives,
 other patients and professional peers, as a failure for the
 therapist. The cost to the doctor can range from a decline in stature
 and prestige, to law suits and disciplining acts within their
 professional association.

<P>
 To prevent suicide, the therapist might prolong the treatment
 indefinitely, adopt different or more coercive forms of treatment,
 raise false hopes, or refer the patient to another professional.
 These options are not inherently bad. However, not addressing the
 possibility of suicide is a betrayal of the patient.

<P>
 The patient trusts the doctor to do what is best for the patient.
 The problem is that they disagree on what the best thing is. A doctor
 denying the possibility of suicide is serving as an agent of social
 control.  The doctor becomes part of the problem rather than the
 solution.

<P>
 For these reasons there are voices on ash against the existing mental
 health establishment, but on the whole, ash is not against it. With
 all its problems we recognize that traditional therapy may be helpful
 to some people. If somebody believes they can benefit from such
 treatment then we would recommend trying it out.  Keep in mind that
 you may likely need to talk to several therapists in order to find
 one that you feel comfortable with.

<P>
 However, one must always remember the limitations of such therapy: if
 while in therapy you are to make a decision about whether to suicide
 or not, you will have to make this decision by yourself, without the
 therapist's assistance. Furthermore, to avoid involuntary
 hospitalization you might have to lie, claiming that although you are
 suicidal you have no intentions of acting upon this, or better yet
 deny that you are suicidal altogether. It is unfortunate that the
 delicate relationship between doctor and patient has to be underlined
 by deception.


<H3><A NAME="II-section-2.3.4.">3.4) Posters who are against suicide</A></H3>
 
<P>
 Ashers are very protective of ash as it's a unique place.  At the
 time of this writing there are over 35000 newsgroups, yet ash is the
 only one that is devoted to talking about suicide in a
 non-judgemental environment. People who deliberately disrupt ash are
 dealt with sometimes quite harshly, but this usually happens after
 the person has been gently told where to find the FAQ (or even been
 emailed it).  They decide that their viewpoint is somehow
 important/unique (it isn't, we've heard it all before) that they
 should receive special status and post their anti-suicide opinion
 anyway. Then they have earned the title of troll.

<P>
 There is a group of regular ash posters who are fiendishly good at
 having a good deal of fun at the troll's expense.  Ashers protect the
 group because they do not want newcomers to misunderstand what ash is
 about.

<HR>

<H2><A NAME="II-section-2.4.">4) Ash Lingo</A></H2>

<H3><A NAME="II-section-2.4.1.">4.1) Pdoc</A></H3>

<P>
 A Pdoc is a shorter word for "psychiatrist" or &quot;psychologist&quot;.


<P>
4.2) 'suicide' vs. 'attempt'

<P>
 A suicide is when a person <EM>has</EM> killed themselves. An attempted
 suicide is where a person has tried, and failed.


<P>
4.3) "catch/climb on/get on/board the bus".

<P>
 The the bus phrase is a much loved ash metaphor for committing
 suicide.  "Does anyone know if XXX caught the bus?" means "Does anyone
 know if XXX died (by suicide)?"  The original idea was created by
 "just another onionhead" and can be found at
 <A HREF="ashbus.html">http://ash.xanthia.com/ashbus.html</A> .

<P>
 Ash itself is often described as a bus stop where several people have
 decided to stop and chat before deciding on whether or not to get on
 the bus.  The image resonates with many ashers. 


<H3><A NAME="II-section-2.4.2.">4.4) Shiny-happy people</A></H3>

<P>
 Shiny-happy people is an ash term that we shamelessly stole from the
 REM song of the same name.  It refers to those who are not 
 ashers yet want to cheer ashers up, however, they can not understand
 or sympathize with someone who is not happy. The most common
 characteristic is if they imply something like: "I'm happy and you
 should be to and here's how...", a message not appropriate for
 ash.

<P>
 Calling them evangelists for happiness would not be far off the mark.
 Shiny-happies give those folks who have gone through bad times and
 are now OK or even happy (something that ash respects) an undeserved
 bad name.


<H3><A NAME="II-section-2.4.3.">4.5) Troll</A></H3>

 An intrusive poster who willfully disregards the posting rules

<H3><A NAME="II-section-2.4.4.">4.6) come out/come out of the closet</A></H3>

<P>
 To come out in an ash context means to tell someone that you are 
 suicidal.  Some will also use the term when telling a person they
 know that they are depressed.


<P>
4.7) &gt;&gt;cuts&lt;&lt;  

<P>
 This is a play on {{hugs}} which is normally used in conventional
 support groups.  The word "cuts" refers to some ashers tendency
 towards self harm.

<P>
 Not all ashers are suicidal or depressed <A HREF="FAQGuides.html#III-REF-1">[1]</A>.  However, many of the
 posts on ash express suicidal viewpoints.  Some people don't believe
 such expressions are for real. They may question the honesty of an
 individual poster who is considering suicide, or even doubt that any
 asher is truly suicidal.

<P>
 There are many problems with arguments which claim that "ashers are
 not <EM>really</EM> suicidal." Often such claims make sweeping assumptions
 about the situation and reasoning of ashers.

<P>
 Some claims assume that ashers post about suicide only because of
 some ulterior motive and are therefore not truly suicidal. However,
 suicidal expressions may have several motivations; just pointing to a
 different motivation (which may or may not be true) does not mean
 that one is not honestly suicidal.

<P>
 Most other claims are the result of a basic misunderstanding of the
 issues related to suicide, and of what ash is about. For an
 introduction to ash please refer to the ASH FAQ part 1: Introduction
 <A HREF="FAQGuides.html#part 1">[1]</A>.

<P>
 The rest of this article expands on common judgments, statements, and
 opinions which doubt the sincerity and motives of ashers.

<HR>

<H2><A NAME="III-section-1.1.">1) You don't really want to die, you just talk about suicide because it is cool</A></H2>

<P>
 Some people think we talk about suicide in ash because we consider it
 "cool" or shocking. In fact, ashers try to take a <EM>realistic</EM>
 approach to suicide. We wish that society would accept this approach
 and not be shocked when suicide occurs or is even merely discussed.

<P>
 To shock people, one would have to talk about something that is not
 acceptable to those people. In ash though, suicide is accepted, so
 talking about it does not shock anybody. By reading some posts, it
 will also become clear that the people in ash don't think suicide is
 cool. Suicide is merely part of life, one possible decision to make.


<H2><A NAME="III-section-1.2.">2) You don't really want to die, you just want attention.</A></H2>

<P>
 Any form of communication is a call for attention.  Every time you
 talk or write to somebody about <EM>any</EM> topic, you are requesting the
 attention of the recipient. This is also true for posts to ash.

<P>
 However, this particular statement generally refers to wanting
 another form of attention.  In this context, "getting attention"
 means either an indirect request for psychiatric help or an effort to
 get others to be more attentive and caring.  The hope in this
 scenario would be that the shock of such an extreme action as suicide
 would cause everyone to reevaluate their relationship with one who
 attempted (or even mentioned) committing suicide.

<P>
 On ash, discussion about suicide is to the point--we are not alarmed
 by suicidal ideation. If somebody wants startled responses, there are
 many forums which could provide it (any of the support newsgroups for
 example). ash is the last place to get this sort of attention.


<H2><A NAME="III-section-1.3.">3) People who failed in their suicide attempt are just looking for attention.</A></H2>

<P>
 Some ashers have had failed attempts in the past.  Perhaps some
 failed attempts are attention ploys, but it would be a mistake to
 generalize this, especially to ashers.  Failed attempts happen
 frequently, even if the person was serious in his/her intentions.
 Suicide is often not easy to carry out (see item (6) below).

<P>
 Trying to commit suicide is often accompanied by high emotional
 stress which in turn may cause confusion about one's intention to
 commit suicide or about the application of the chosen method. Some
 people may want to exit, yet at the same time have hopes for rescue
 and a better life. Other people fail attempts due to apathy--at the
 time of the attempt they do not care whether they live or die. Such
 half-hearted attempts are likely to fail. For people whose attempt
 has failed for these reasons, the motivation for suicide may persist,
 and thus they might commit suicide in the future.

<P>
 Note that even if drawing attention is one motive for displaying
 suicidal gestures, this does not exclude the possibility that these
 people are also truly suicidal and may eventually kill themselves.

<P>
 Most people who accuse us of wanting to get attention seem to focus
 on some sort of supportive attention that would be the result of the
 attempt.  But in many cases, the attention one gets after a failed
 attempt is far from supportive. People stay away or treat you
 differently after an attempt. Chances are you will be closely watched
 by all sorts of people, maybe even be "persuaded" to get involved
 with mental health care. The problem with asking for attention by way
 of a suicidal gesture is that you can never be sure what kind of
 attention you will get.

<P>
 Mental health practitioners consider suicide attempts to be one of
 the best indications of a risk for suicide. About 30 to 40 percent of
 suicides have made a previous attempt. Furthermore, the probability
 of completed suicide is 100 times greater than average in the first
 year after an attempt. <A HREF="FAQGuides.html#III-REF-2">[2]</A>

<P>
 Just because someone fails in an effort to kill themselves doesn't
 mean they weren't sincere about it and clear in their intent.


<H2><A NAME="III-section-1.4.">4) You don't *really* want to die, otherwise you would have done so by now.</A></H2>

<P>
 Obviously, <EM>some</EM> people really want to die since people do manage to
 commit suicide. This includes people who used to post to ash. <A HREF="FAQGuides.html#III-REF-3">[3]</A>
 There is a stigma that people who commit suicide do it irrationally,
 spontaneously or without much thought. The conclusion would be that
 if people have suicidal thoughts then they would commit suicide
 within a short period of time.

<P>
 In fact, many people give much thought to whether they should commit
 suicide as in the case of Dan Reinfurt <A HREF="FAQGuides.html#III-REF-4">[4]</A>. This is only logical
 since the decision is perhaps the most difficult one ever has to
 make.  However, there are additional factors which prolong this
 decision making process.

<P>
 In any important life decision it is possible to consult books,
 people or experts to help one decide.  Ironically, for the most
 difficult decision--to be or not to be--no assistance is possible.

<P>
 Many complicating factors require significant time to think through
 in order to decide whether or not to commit suicide.  But even if one
 has decided to exit, there is also a matter of choosing, planning,
 and carrying out a suicide method.  Suicide is not easy (see below)
 and many people require much deliberation before deciding how to go
 about it.

<P>
 Finally, there are people who are suicidal, yet still choose not to
 commit suicide, at least for the time being. Some are not able to
 eliminate their suicidal tendencies even though they have tried to do
 so.  Others may feel that being suicidal is part of their true
 identity. In either case, they choose to accept that they are
 suicidal rather than fight it. They have the desire to die, yet they
 decide to live.

<P>
 Suicidal ashers are in various stages of deliberation.  By open
 discussion, ash encourages people to evaluate their situation
 carefully and rationally.  Some are trying to make decisions about
 their lives, others just like to talk with like-minded people. This
 is what fuels the paradox of a crowded pro-choice-suicide group, and
 what keeps ashers around for many years.


<H2><A NAME="III-section-1.5.">5) You don't *really* want to die, you just want to have a better life.</A></H2>

<P>
 Some ashers believe that if they had a better life, they would not
 want to die.  Others believe that they would want to die no matter
 what changed in their life.  A better life is simply not attainable
 for some people. If one's body, family, spirit, emotions, or mind
 have been irreparably damaged, there may be no way to attain a better
 life in the ways that truly matter. Some have tried for a better life
 for so long that they no longer believe it is possible.  They desire
 only death.

<P>
 It is possible to want a better life and at the same time crave
 death.  If you are hungry, you may want a sandwich and at the same
 time crave a pizza.  Either would take away the discomfort of hunger.
 Either death or a better life would take away the life of misery many
 ashers experience. Regardless of their motivation, ashers have chosen
 to accept suicide as their most likely way to deal with their present
 situation.


<H2><A NAME="III-section-1.6.">6) It is easy to commit suicide.</A></H2>

<P>
 This claim is commonly used to support the argument above (i.e.,
 if you wanted to die you would have done so by now). 

<P>
 On the surface, the availability of methods, such as jumping from a
 high place, supports the claim that suicide is easy.  However,
 availability is not the only obstacle.  Three stages are necessary to
 commit suicide.  All of them introduce problems.

<OL>
  <LI>Getting the physical means of suicide:
    Many of the more reliable methods are difficult to obtain.  For
    example, suitable drugs/poison in lethal quantities are only easily
    accessible by doctors, pharmacists, or chemists.  Guns are readily
    available only in some areas.

  <LI>Using the physical means appropriately:
    To apply a method quickly, painlessly, and with high probability to
    succeed, it is vital to know how to apply it correctly . Although a
    small number of authoritative books on methods are available, the
    information they contain is not completely reliable since no real
    tests can be performed for confirmation. For example, the toxicity
    of various substances is measured by administering them to
    laboratory animals, whose reactions may differ from those of
    humans. For most other methods there are no empirical data to confirm
    successful method usage. Although there is a lot of information on
    the net, it is of low credibility; at best it relies on the books
    already mentioned above.

  <LI>Getting over the psychological barrier:
    Suicide is against our instincts.  We are programmed to fear
    death, to survive. Overcoming this fear is not easy. It can be
    terribly hard to take the last step. To jump. To pull the trigger.

</OL>
<P>
 There are methods in which some of these stages are easy, but usually
 the other stages will be very difficult. For example, methods which
 are physically easy to execute usually require much more
 determination in order to carry them out (taking a bunch of pills is
 a lot easier than jumping from a high building), and thus the
 psychological barrier is more difficult to overcome.

<P>
 Indeed, of the three stages the psychological barrier is the most
 significant.  Many factors contributing to the psychological barrier
 are the consequence of problems with using the physical means
 appropriately (the second stage). The following are just some of
 these factors:

<UL>
  <LI>Lack of assistance:
   There are many risks one has to face when committing suicide.  In
   practically any risky task one would have some kind of assistance from
   a professional (e.g., a doctor or instructor), who would not only
   ensure that your physical gear is in order, but would help you carry
   out the task step by step and provide encouragement and support. Can
   you imagine going to a psychologist and asking for help to get over
   the fear of committing suicide?  No assistance is possible when
   committing suicide, and that makes the task much harder.

  <LI>Agonizing death:
   The risk of having a slow and agonizing death is what many people
   fear most, since it is likely that the person committing the act
   would not be able to alleviate his/her own pains. Add to this the fact
   that suicide is usually done in solitude (so there are no other
   people who can help) and you can imagine how one would continue to
   helplessly suffer until death.

  <LI>Survival:
   There are no 100% guaranteed methods. A failed attempt may occur due
   to poor execution of the chosen method, or even due to being "saved"
   by a friend. If the attempt caused injury, one might not be
   physically capable of carrying out another attempt, and thus would
   be forced to live in a situation much worse than before, truly
   deprived of any escape. This can be compounded by having to face
   family and friends, who might treat you differently (or even
   cut their connections with you).  To top it off one might be
   forced to undergo psychiatric treatment. In light of the physical
   and emotional pain which might be caused, the risk of survival could
   be paralyzing.


</UL>
<P>
 There are other factors which contribute to the psychological barrier:

<UL>
  <LI>Lack of role models:
   A role model is someone who does things you admire, who you look up
   to, or who you want to be like. There are very few role models for
   suicide. Just the fact that you see other people do it makes it a
   lot easier to do it yourself. Having a role model has a significant
   impact on the ability to commit suicide. There is evidence that
   suicide reports in media cause an increase in suicide using the same
   method.<A HREF="FAQGuides.html#III-REF-5">[5]</A>  In an effort to prevent suicides by diminishing the
   effect of possible role models, Centers for Disease Control in the
   USA have developed guidelines for mass-media coverage and for
   counseling of close friends of those who have attempted or committed
   suicide.<A HREF="FAQGuides.html#III-REF-6">[6]</A>  The concern of mental health practitioners of what they
   refer to as "imitation" or "contagion" indicates that the lack of
   role models makes suicide more difficult to carry out.

  <LI>Norms of society:
   Yet another factor is connected to societal norms. It is much more
   difficult to do something that society disagrees with. This is probably
   when courage is really tested to the limit.  All our lives we are
   taught to conform. Some people might find it difficult to "rebel" in
   any manner, however irrational their submission to society might be.

  <LI>Indecision:
   Obviously, before one takes steps to exit, they must make a decision
   that they indeed want to commit suicide. Some factors, which are
   similar to those contributing to the psychological barrier, also
   affect this decision process. Even after a decision to exit has been
   made, the lack of assistance in making the decision, lack of role
   models, and the norms of society would raise doubts in any rational
   human being. It requires great determination to follow such a decision
   given its overwhelming significance on one hand, and the limiting 
   constraints under which it was made on the other.

</UL>
<P>
 These factors explain some of the difficulties facing one who wants
 to commit suicide, however, their effect varies for different people.
 It may be difficult for some and not for others.

<HR>

<P>
Conclusion:

<P>
 The common claim that ashers "do not <EM>really</EM> want to die" usually
 implies that ashers are hypocrites and probably not suicidal at
 all. However, in light of the issues addressed in this FAQ, it is not
 at all clear what the phrase "<EM>really</EM> suicidal" actually means.

<P>
 For example, in the context of the claim "You don't <EM>really</EM> want to
 die, otherwise you would have done so by now," the expression "you
 don't really want to die" only means that up until now you did not
 want to die <EM>enough</EM> to actually do it.

<P>
 All other claims presented here do not make any substantiated
 argument that indicates that ashers are not suicidal. "You are not
 really suicidal", is just a meaningless slogan intended to
 delegitimize our right to contemplate or even just talk about
 suicide.

<h3><a name="IV-0">0  Foreword</a></h3> 

    Suicide is not uncommon. It is the third most common cause of
    death among young adults in North America after car wrecks and
    homicides [2]. The subject of suicide is highly sensitive and
    complicated. It involves philosophical, psychological, medical,
    theological and legal issues. 
<p>
    Most people believe suicide is foolish, crazy, and/or immoral.
    When suicide is discussed it is routinely condemned, however,
    since the topic is taboo, people are rarely willing to discuss it
    even hypothetically.
<p>
    It is ironic that an event as common as suicide is one that permits
    little discussion in any venue due to the fiercely held opinions
    against it.
<p>
    Although some people may agree in theory to a person's right to
    suicide, they are unwilling to address the individual's right to a
    reliable means of death. A suicidal person has no access to
    professional assistance in self-delivery.
<p>
    Suicide is reported in the media and many people have known someone
    who committed suicide.  Why is such a relevant topic not explored
    in open conversation? How can such an intractable issue be approached?
    Why are so many people so sure about their convictions?  Why is
    it that ash, one of the few places where the pros and cons of suicide 
    may be discussed freely, is seen as a terrible influence that should
    be bombarded with the same invalidating, condemnatory comments again
    and again?
<p>
    Clichs allow society to bridge the gap between the inherent
    complexities of the problem and the will of society to preserve
    life. Some clichs divert attention from the topic. Some exploit
    the psychological situation of people who want to commit
    suicide. But many of them are simply irrelevant, illogical or rely
    on questionable assumptions [3]. Clichs are simple enough for
    everyone to understand but they don't really address the issues.
<p>
    The current state is one of paranoia, where any suicidal tendency
    is regarded as an illness to be cured. In some cases, suicidal
    desires are indeed a symptom of illness, but many other situations
    are not so clear cut as society would have us believe.
<p>
    Even dying patients in excruciating pain are not allowed to end 
    their life.  How can society be so numb to the needs of its citizens? 
    In the 21st century, we are still using the Hippocratic oath[4], 
    which is more than 2000 years old, as our moral guide.
<p> 
    Changing these attitudes is not an easy task. This is demonstrated
    by the fight of euthanasia organizations around the world to
    change legislation and allow the terminally ill and the aged to
    end their lives in peace. Their slow progress is due to the
    democratic society we most live in. Indeed democracy is the rule
    of the majority via representatives, and people who wish to commit
    suicide are always the minority (and are a weak one at that since
    suicidal people often do not have the energy to be politically
    active).
<p>
    However, democracy is not simply the rule of the majority.  The essence
    of democracy is in the restrictions that should be placed on the
    government to preserve the individual's rights from the will of the
    majority.
<p>
    We are lucky to live in times where values are constantly
    changing.  Minorities around the world are reclaiming their
    natural rights, from the progress of women's liberation movements
    to the fall of apartheid.  Sexual preferences, for which in the
    past one could be sent to jail, are increasingly recognized as the
    private concern of the individuals involved.  The control over our 
    bodies, the ultimate civil right, is yet another limit our governing 
    bodies should acknowledge and embrace.

<hr> 
<h4><a name="IV-0.1">0.1  Goals of FAQ</a></h4>

    The ash newsgroup is under constant attack from pro-life
    advocates.  This is an attempt to organize these attacks and
    answer them.  No attempt is made to show that suicide is right,
    permissible or moral in general or in particular cases. 
<p>
    The only thing demonstrated here is that suicide is not proven to be wrong
    by these attacks.

<p>
    This should come as no surprise. Most moral questions are difficult
    or even impossible to resolve one way or the other. What *is* surprising
    is the conviction of some pro-life posters and total disregard to the
    opinions of ashers. Although this document might actually convince some
    pro-lifers that they are wrong, its real purpose is to help people
    who are new to ash to *understand* our point view 
    and realize that the issues are far from trivial.

<p>
    For regular ashers, the FAQ can serve as a repository of answers to various
    pro-life arguments, but as a whole it serves another purpose.
    Being depressed, suicidal, and always hearing 'suicide is not a solution', 
    'only madmen contemplate suicide' makes some people feel more guilty and 
    more depressed. Seeing it as a choice can help people, without having to 
    burden them more by getting more depressed by their depression.


<h4><a name="IV-0.2">0.2  Organization of FAQ</a></h4>

    We tried to include most of the arguments we could find.  Some of
    these have been the discussion of philosophers for
    centuries. Other attacks are silly but are still frequently
    posted.  Not all arguments could possibly be added to this FAQ.
    The basic criteria for exclusion is if the answer is too simple to
    be of interest.
<p>
    The first question if obvious: "is suicide immoral?". This breaks
    up into three different questions. Is suicide immoral towards god?
    towards society? or towards oneself?
<p>

    Suppose that the conclusion is that suicide cannot be proven to be
    immoral. The debate is not over. A pro life advocate can still
    claim that suicide is irrational.  Informally, we consider an act
    to be irrational if neither the person doing the act, nor anyone
    else, is able to explain the act by showing that there are good
    reasons for doing it.
<p>

    Immorality towards god is discussed in section 1, and towards
    society and self in section 2.     
    Section 3 contains arguments which usually appear on ash as
    unsubstantiated statements against suicide in general.
<p>
    The first 3 sections answer a-priori arguments against suicide,
    i.e.  arguments derived by reasoning from self-evident
    propositions which are independent of experience. Such arguments
    claim that no person can be justified in committing suicide. In
    contrast, the following 2 sections implicitly acknowledge that in
    some cases, suicide is justified, however, in practice, most cases
    are not.  This direction is pursued, using findings from
    suicidology, in section 4.  The arguments in section 5 makes
    generalizing claims about the rationality of those committing
    suicide.
    
<p>
    The question of whether society
    has a right to prevent people from committing suicide  
    (e.g. by legislation) is not in
    the scope of this FAQ.

<h3><a name="IV-1">1  Duty to god</a></h3>

    Many ashers are atheists, therefore claims about moral obligations to god
    have no effect on them. 
    On the other hand someone who strictly follows a particular religion
    must accept some of the following claims, however, these 
    are a minority among ash readers since religion provides
    inherent psychological solutions, which would prevent such people
    from coming to ash in the first place.
<p>

    To make things interesting we assume that answers to the following
    cliches are made by a somewhat sceptical theist who believes in a
    super being but questions the insight of common religions. Such a
    combination is possible: David Hume [1], an 18th century
    philosopher, believed in god but did not consider suicide to be a
    crime against ourselves, society or god.


<h4><a name="IV-1.1">  1.1  Life is a gift from god.</a></h4>

    What this clich implies is that we should take care of our lives.
    This is our duty to god. God gave us this gift for us to keep.
<p>

   Answer:
<p>

    If life is a gift then I should be allowed to do whatever I want
    with it once it's mine, this includes throwing the gift away.
<p>

    What the clich suggests is that since god has given us the
    precious gift of life (and thus has been good to us) then we
    should return the favor and preserve ourselves to the best of our
    ability since this is gods wish ( well that's the reason he gave us
    life in the first place isn't it? ).  Many ashers will say that
    life is a burden, not a gift, so they feel no need to return gods
    "favor".


<h4><a name="IV-1.2">  1.2  People who commit suicide go to hell.</a></h4>

    The basic Christian belief about suicide is that God has given us
    the gift of life and that there is some divine purpose to it.  But
    to convolute this "purpose" we are also given free will.  This
    free will is so that we can choose good or evil.  Committing
    suicide is evil since one abandons hope in God, and without God
    all that is left is evil.  After death those who have chosen good
    end up in Heaven and those who have chosen evil are eternally
    tormented in Hell.
<p>

    Islam has clear principles regarding suicide. The prophet Muhammad
    said that people who commit suicide will spend eternity killing
    themselves just as they did in this world. Do you really want to
    spend eternity shooting yourself in the mouth or poisoning
    yourself?
<p> 

    In Buddhism , the basic belief is that whatever effects from
    whatever karma you're suffering from now will follow you into your
    next life, and in fact probably have followed you from your last
    life because you didn't deal with it then.  In other words, you
    might as well deal with it now and change whatever is bothering
    you as you'll have to eventually.
<p>

   Answer:
<p>

    This is a good method of social control to convince people that
    depending on their behavior, they would wind up someplace totally
    pleasant or unbearable for eternity, after death.  But the fact is
    that we don't really know what happens when we die and we shall
    probably never know.
<p>

    This can be viewed as an issue of religion evolution. A religion
    which would encourage suicide would not survive very long.
    However, a religion which condemns suicide is more attractive ( to
    most people ) so such religions have prevailed. Most people are
    not in a suicidal state, so such religions are a better match to
    their point of view.
<p> 

    People who commit suicide for the usual reasons (emotional
    problems or deep pain of some sort) often act out of fear or hurt
    rather than willfully, they are not fully responsible for their
    actions.  I have a hard time believing that God will be anything
    less than fair and merciful to these people, even if they do kill
    themselves.


<h4><a name="IV-1.3">  1.3  Believe in god and he will save you from suicide</a></h4>

    "my belief in God and faith in his love and power is the
     only thing that's held me back from committing suicide"
<p>

   Answer:
<p> 

    It wasn't the grace of the benevolent and merciful god which saved
    you from suicide, but simply -your belief- in him.  Your power of
    decision.
<p>

<h4><a name="IV-1.4">  1.4  Only god decides in matters of life and death</a></h4>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
   Were the disposal of human life so much reserved as the peculiar
   province of the Almighty, that it were an encroachment on his
   right, for men to dispose of their own lives; it would be equally
   criminal to act for the preservation of life as for its
   destruction. If I turn aside a stone which is falling upon my head,
   I disturb the course of nature, and I invade the peculiar province
   of the Almighty, by lengthening out my life beyond the period which
   by the general laws of matter and motion he had assigned it.

<p> 

   The paradox is that if life and death is totally in the hands of
   god then to extend our lives or to terminate them is equally
   sinful. In this case a rock is about to fall on someone's head.
   This is a natural event. Since god created the universe and all the
   physical laws which govern matter then the fall of the rock is
   god's will. To avoid the rock would be a sin.

<h3><a name="IV-2">2  The Philosophical Debate</a></h3>

  These clichs refer to the relationship and duties of the 
  person committing suicide to society.


<h4><a name="IV-2.1">  2.1  Duty to society (Suicide is selfish)</a></h4>

    We all have duties to society, family and friends.
<BLOCKQUOTE>

   ... every part, as such, belongs to the whole. Now every man is
   part of the community, and so, as such, he belongs to the
   community.  Hence by killing himself he injures the community ...

   </center>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>

   Answer:
<p>

    This could be turned on its head, of course: *not* to suicide, in
    the light of the vast overpopulation of the world, is an extremely
    self-centered act.  Therefore evil or negative.  It's an equally
    valid point, which makes it fair rebuttal.
<p>

    From a more traditional point of view suicide might be considered
    a selfish act, but aren't most actions we take selfish?  And don't
    our family and friends want us to continue to live for their own
    selfish reasons?  Note also that in some cases the people around
    you (society, family and friends) are the ones contributing to (if
    not causing) your torture, and thus to your will to commit suicide,
    should we be bound by duties to others in such a case?
<p>

    The sole argument that suicide is selfish doesn't mean that
    it shouldn't be allowed. Let's consider a man who leaves his
    country, family and friends, and goes for instance to India to
    join a secluded religious sect. He too has abandoned all of his
    previous duties, but his acts are not illegal.
<p>

    I wonder what people who use this clich would say about an old
    lonely man who has no friends and family and is retired ( so he is
    also of no use to society ).  Would they approve the suicide of
    such a man?  I guess not. However the death of this man does not
    cause any harm to the community. Furthermore, even if 
    it might be possible for this man to contribute to society
    ( doing some volunteer work at a hospital for example ) then the 
    cost of suffering for this man might still substantially outweigh 
    the benefits for society.


<h4><a name="IV-2.2">  2.2 Life is the only thing you have.</a></h4>

    "Maybe life is depressing. But it's all we got.
     How can you give it up for nothing?"
<p>

   Answer:
<p>

    People who use the clich are performing a "mapping" from the
    state of mind of an individual to ... lets say the non negative
    integers!  Where death = 0 and anything else is positive. The
    analogy seems logical since when we die we don't exist, there is
    nothing, zero. The problem is that they are mixing up between the
    physical state and the mental state. Nobody can have a negative
    amount of bodies, but why map the mental state ( which is what
    matters ) into the non negatives? Are there mental states which
    are worse than death? I think there are but there is no way to
    prove it one way or the other.

<hr>
<h3><a name="IV-3">3  Layman clichs</a></h3>
    
    The following sections are common lines which appear in many
    posts. These are usually stated without any substantiation.

<H4><a name="IV-3.1">  3.1  Suicide is not a solution.</a></h4>

   Answer:
<p>

    Of course it's a solution.  A solution is an action which when
    taken at a state with a problem, results to another state without
    that problem.  So when one commits suicide he definitely solves
    his problems ( all of them at once as a matter of fact ), however
    he might create new problems to other people, but this is a
    different matter.
<p>

    Perhaps what people really mean when they say this clich is
    actually a bit more complicated. What they mean is that committing
    suicide is not in the framework, it does not conform to the moral
    system of the society.<p>

    Like if somebody comes up with an original solution to a riddle.
    Suppose the riddle involves crossing a river with some limited
    means and somebody tries to solve it by saying 
    "They can cross the river with a helicopter" albeit a helicopter
    was not mentioned in the riddle. Someone might then say &quot;that's not a solution" because the framework was broken.
    Generally in riddles you should use only the presented objects.
<p>

    Society has its own framework - values. And when it's broken
    some people might reply "that is not a solution".
<p>

    But perhaps the real problem in this clich is defining the
    problem to which suicide is or is not a solution. 
    Indeed there are many problems that suicide does not solve,
    Islamic fundamentalism and global warming to name a few.
    If the problem is "find happiness" then suicide is not a 
    solution, but if it's "stop pain" then it is. At least give
    us the credit of defining our own problems.
    


<h4><a name="IV-3.2">  3.2 Suicide is not natural</a></h4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    ... everything naturally loves itself, the result being that everything 
    naturally keeps itself in being, and resists corruptions so far as 
    it can. Wherefore suicide is
    contrary to the inclination of nature,... Hence suicide is always 
    a mortal sin, as being contrary to the natural law

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>

   Answer:
<p>
   It is not true that all things naturally avoid self destruction.
   It is a well known phenomena that groups of whales get stranded on 
   beaches, and ultimately die. This does not seem to be just an accident. 
<p> 

   Furthermore, some people are also naturally inclined to kill
   themselves. For instance, people suffering from inbarable pain and
   who are terminally ill.
<p>

   Another point is that the fact that an act runs against one's
   nature this doesn't mean that this act is immoral or unlawful. Ear
   piercing is quite unnatural, and in fact painful, yet acceptable
   for women ( and men ) in most societies.

<h3><a name="IV-4">4 The Suicidological Debate</a></h3>

<p>
 Suicidology is a field of research which employs methods and findings
 from sociology, psychology and psychiatry for the research and
 prevention of suicide. 
<p>
 Some suicidologists feel that the philosophical approach to the issue
 of suicide is too distant and abstract[8]. They claim that this
 approach has lead people to the misguided conclusion that rational
 suicide is to be accepted. According to [7], a better approach might
 be to use the knowledge and findings made by mental health practitioners and researches which are familiar with suicide in
 reality, and thus have a better understanding of the issues involved.
<p>
 However, the suicidological approach has several problems.
 Suicidology, as any social science, uses empirical research that can
 only provide predictions which are probabilistic by nature. For
 example, even if it would be possible to perform some research which
 would conclude that suicide, in practice, is irrational, the most
 that could be hoped to predict is that it would be irrational for a
 high percentage of the population. Yet still for some of the population
 it could be rational.
<p>
 No research in the social sciences can lead to a conclusion that
 suicide is categorically wrong or irrational. The refusal of the
 mental health establishment to assist in cases where suicide 
 is rational is evidence that the real reason behind their 
 approach is their moral values, which brings us right back to the 
 philosophical debate.
<p>
 Another problem is cultural. All findings are based on research which
 is performed in a society which is predominantly pro-life. This may
 have a great affect on the results of the research, not just because
 of the assumptions of the ones carrying out the research, but mainly
 because the subjects of such research have grown up in such a society.
<p>
 Note that the subject of suicide is mostly taboo. Mental health
 professionals provide no counseling on choosing whether or not to 
 commit suicide. They can only help in *exploring* *life*. By not providing counseling
 on choice, mental 
 health practitioners are encouraging irrational decisions about suicide.
<p>
 Finally, the fact that suicidologists are not versed in philosophy 
 makes much of their research prone to logical fallacies. These are
 usually circular arguments where the researcher assumes that suicide 
 is wrong and the research is used to reaffirm that assumption.
<p>
 Returning to the problem of choosing between the philosophical and
 the suicidological approaches, the question remains: what is the 
 *appropriate* tool for analyzing the problem of suicide.
 Perhaps philosophy may seem too distant from the problem, but 
 suicidology is too close. One main goal of suicidology is to
 prevent suicide. One cannot expect a discipline which is based so 
 deeply on the assumption that suicide is wrong, to be able to turn
 back and question its own foundations. Only philosophy allows us 
 to look at our cultural influences and false beliefs from a distance,
 and clarify the big picture.

 4.1 Suicide among the terminally ill 


  in [7]:
  suicide rate of cancer patients is lower than general population.
  "If suicide is such an obviously rational alternative to enduring
   the painful consequences of a disease running its expectably torturous
   course, why do so few cancer patients attempt or commit suicide?"

  "A recent study by Brown et al. [16]... . Fourty four terminally ill
  patients were studied (all but one were diagnosed with neoplastic desease)
  to determine if they 'desired death'. Of these, thirty four had never had
  suicidal thoughts or wished that death would come early. Only one of this
  group was suffering from clinical depression. The remaining ten who had 
  desired premature death or had contemplated suicide were all found to be
  suffering from severe depressive illness. This data suggests that the wish
  to die among terminally ill patients is not a rational adaptive response,
  but rather is associated with the presence of an emotional disorder.

  The low suicide rates among cancer patients is all the more
  compelling given that the usual societal proscriptions governing
  suicidal behavior have been relaxed in the case of the terminally
  ill. On this basis alone we would expect a significantly higher
  suicide rate among individuals with neoplasms. That this does not
  occure suggests that in case of suicide among this population, the
  actual physical distress of the illness may be of less significance
  in determining a suicidal outcome than the basic adaptive pattern of
  the individual and the responses of those around him.
  Available research supports this conclusion. In a study which compared
  thirty two terminal cancer patients who comitted suicide with a control group who did 
  not commit suicide but died of the disease, Farberow et al. (17) discovered
  distintive psychological patterns that characterized the suicide group.
  Among these were: the experiencing of emotional distress over an above
  the physiologic aspects of the disease; the exhaustion of physical and 
  emotional resources (including a feeling of lack of family or hospital 
  staff support); and a history of prior suicide threats or attempts.
 
  Weisman(14), who has carried out extensive research on cancer patients,
  contends that the few who do attempt suicide are characterized by a patter of extreme
  family strife , alcohol abuse or a paranoid hatred of others. He concludes,
  'Hopelessness about cancer is never offered as a sufficient reason.'
  There is also clinical evidence that the cancer patient at greates risk of 
  suicide is generally at a very advanced stage of his illness and is likely
  to have given previous indications of deficient psychological resources and difficulties
  in adjusting to his illness(18)"


 3.2) Rationality

 Suicidoligists claim that suicidal people generally have impaired
 reasoning with regard to suicide

  From [7]
  "to the extent that effective unimpaired reasoning is implicit in the notion 
   of a rational suicide, suicidal individuals are generally not capable of such
   a considered action. Deression rigidifies their thinking and hinders their
   ability to envision alternative or make judgements concerning the
   probably outcomes of different available options. It constricts and 
   narrows their view concerning future possibilities. Their thinking reflects
   a twisted sense of values and impoverished insight. An objective, rational
   view of life is rarely present (21-23).


 3.3) Culturally biased definition of rational suicide:
  from [7]:
  "The defining characteristics of a rational suicide are: 
   (a) the individual possesses a realistic assessment of his situation
   (b) the mental processes leading to his decision to commit suicide are 
       unimpaired by psychological illness or severe emotional distress, and
   (c) the motivational basis of his decision would be understandable to 
       the majority of uninvolved observers from his community or social group."


* Feelings are more important than rationality:
  From [7]:
  "Alfred Hoche(20)...  

  Hoche's concept of a carefully evaluated and reasoned decision to commit
  suicide points up a number of problems with the rational suicide position.
  The first is its emphasis on cognition. It is in the realm of emotions - 
  about one's self-worth and one's relationships with significant others - that
  the urge to suicide originates and must be stemmed. It is through restoring
  feelings of self-esteem, acceptance, and attachments to others that the
  clinician seeks to expunge suicidal ideation and behavior.


* Hope in the future

  From [7]:
  "Additionally, as Brandt (22) has pointed out, even when suicidal individuals
  can be made to acknowledge that their cicumstances may improve significantly
  at future time, distant events or opportunitites tend to exert a small 
  motivational force on present behavior.

<h3><a name="IV-5">5  Layman clichs about rationality </a></h3>
    
    These clichs analyze the reasons why people want to die and then
    claim that these reasons do not justify suicide.  Perhaps some of them our true for some
    people. But doing something for the wrong reasons is only bad if
    the action, suicide in this case, is itself wrong. These clichs don't deal with this aspect at all. People can do good things for
    bad reasons and bad things for good reasons.


<h4><a name="IV-5.1">  5.1  Suicide is the easy way out.</a></h4>

   Answer:
<p>

    What the clich implies is that people who commit suicide are
    choosing the easy solution instead of the "correct" solution.
    This clich simply defers the discussion from the real issue - is
    suicide a solution.
<p>
    
    The fact is that committing suicide is not easy ( see part 3 ),
    however if at a given situation suicide is
    indeed the easiest solution, this alone is not a negative property
    and does not comprise a reason not to take it.  In fact easiness
    is usually positive, isn't this what the western society is all
    about.  Doing things more efficient, faster, easier.


<h4><a name="IV-5.2">  5.2  Suicide is an act of a coward.</a></h4>

   Answer:
<p>

    This is very similar to the previous clich, but with a twist of
    slander.  It is also a dangerous generalization.  There are many
    reasons to commit suicide.  The obvious example is the terminally
    ill who simply want to alleviate their suffering.
<p>

    Again, committing suicide requires courage, however even if it is
    least courageous option it does not make the action itself wrong.
    In combat a soldier might commit an act of bravery just because he
    is afraid of the reaction of his peers if he would not do that
    action ( this is part of the way how soldiers are conditioned to
    behave like killing machines ). A good act was motivated by a
    seemingly bad reason ( cowardliness ). The action also required
    courage, but perhaps less than facing the other soldiers in his
    unit.
  
<h4><a name="IV-5.2">  5.3  Aren't all suicidal people crazy? </a></h4>

   Answer:
<p>

  No, having suicidal thoughts does not imply that one is crazy, or necessarily mentally
  ill [9]. For example, Appleby and Condonis[10] write: 

  <blockquote>
  The majority of individuals who commit suicide do not have a diagnosable mental illness.
  They are people just like you and I who at a particular time are feeling isolated,
  desperately unhappy and alone. Suicidal thoughts and actions may be the result of life's
  stresses and losses that the individual feels they just can't cope with. 
  </blockquote>

  Note that the definition of depression as a diagnosable mental
  illnesses is inexact, and varies according to the culture and also
  the person making the diagnosis. It is not unlikely that in a society
  which objects to suicide, more suicidal people would be unjustly classified
  as mentally ill in order to be able to enforce treatment upon them.

  Of course, some people who are suicidal do have some mental illness.
  Even so, describing someone as "crazy", which has strong negative
  connotations, isn't helpful and is more likely to dissuade someone
  from seeking help which may be beneficial, whether they have a
  diagnosable mental illness or not.

<h4><a name="IV-5.4"> 5.4 Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem </a></h4>
  Answer:
<p>
  First of all, for many, the problems are not temporary. The obvious example
  is the terminally ill. Depression also, is not "curable" in all cases.
<p>
  However, even in cases where the problem is temporary suicide could
  still be a rational decision[11].
