From: conibear@sol.carleton.ca (Dave Conibear)
Subject: Here we go...
Organization: Carleton University
Date: Wed, 30 Sep 1992 17:19:19 GMT

Hey, fellow ASHers!  Listen up, because this is the closest thing to
A Note that I'm going to write.

After a lot of research and a lot more thought, I've gone with the KCN
dissolved in cold water.  I'm not quite sure about the volume of 1.5g
of KCN, so I'm erring on the high side.  Yes, I know I'm subject to
&quot;throat irritation&quot; if I do that... sometimes, ya just gotta live on
the edge.  :)

I'm expecting unconsciousness after about 1 minute.  I've skipped all
meals for the past 24 hours to make sure I've got a nice acidic
stomach (HCl + KCN -&gt; KCl + HCN(g), I hope), and when my stomach
started rumbling embarrassingly, I quaffed a grapefruit juice (most
acidic thing I could think of offhand).

I'll be going with the &quot;plastic bag and rubber band&quot; backup system...
a nice big garbage bag, so I won't be uncomfortable for that minute of
consciousness.

The computer is programmed to wait 36 hours and then phone 911, to
prevent any of my friends discovering the body.  This news message is
also on a delay timer, just in case there are any closet
interventionists lurking.

If this DOESN'T work, I'll try to get someone to post that tidbit to
a.s.h. so none of you ends up making the same mistake.

Oh, a final note... in case the group gets any flak about this, let it
be known that a.s.h. was not a promoting cause in my suicide.  Had it
not been for this group, my best plan to date was to get pissed drunk
and dive off the roof of my apartment building (yes, I have a key).  I
think this is cleaner all 'round.

Have a nice life!

Dave
