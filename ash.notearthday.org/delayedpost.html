<p>
First, you need a Linux shell account.  If you have a non-Linux
shell, a lot of this is probably applicable, but I'm only aiming
for testing under Linux.  I am aiming this at someone who knows
the very basics.  I assume you have and use tcsh on your system.
Most systems have it (to check, 'which tcsh' , if you have it, 
then 'chsh' enter your password, and type in the path that
which told you lead to tcsh).  anytime when in a list of "things
you should type" and there is a Ctrl_X that means you should push
'X' while holding the control key... tough stuff, huh?</p><p>

Now, you have a shell account, next you need to be able to post
news.  Download&nbsp; <a href="http://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/news/transport/suck-4.2.1.tar.gz">http://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/news/transport/suck-4.2.1.tar.gz&nbsp;</a>
and type</p>
<pre>
<font color="#FFFF00">tar -zxf suck-4.2.1.tar.gz
cd suck-4.2.1
./configure &amp;&amp; make
mkdir ~/bin
cp rpost ~/bin/.</font>
</pre>
make sure that ~/bin is in your path.  To do this, type
'echo $PATH'  If you don't know how to
then do
<pre>
<font color="#FFFF00">cat &gt;&gt; ~/.tcshrc
set path=( . ~/bin /usr/local/bin /bin /usr/bin /usr/X11/bin \
/usr/sbin /sbin )
ctrl_d
exec tcsh
</font></pre>
you should have no problems... if so, learn how to fix your shell on your
own... if you really don't want to do that, then simply replace
'cat > ~/.tcshrc' for 'cat >> ~/.tcshrc' (hint: look at the number
of "greater than" signs...) ... if you still have problems, get a
working version of tcsh/fix /etc/csh.login ... I'm not gonna
mess with an already non-working system<p>

now that you have rpost working, it is now time to write your bye-bye
note to ash.  Use whatever text editor you want, or simply
'cat > goodbye' followed by your text and a Ctrl_d .  You must stick
to a certain form for your article.  Below is example text</p>
<pre>
----------------------------
From: you@whereever.com
Newsgroups: alt.suicide.holiday
Organization: Mt. Dew worshipers of america
Subject: fill in subject here

How you simply place your message, and sign it...

    -c
---------------------------
</pre>
<p>
of course, you change the fields after From: to your liking... you must
have a Subject: and Newsgroups: (and I think a From: though i'm not sure). 
</p><p>how about a test message... replace alt.suicide.holiday with alt.test (do not use
a valid From: unless you like lots of spam) and save it as outfile.
Then type <pre><font color="#FFFF00">rpost [your news server] &lt; outfile</font></pre> (feel free to switch
file names) where you replace the contents of the bracketed statement
(including the brackets) with the name of your news server.  For me, my
nntp server is called 'news' and thus I do 'rpost news < outfile  Go make sure
that everything posted right.  As this works for me, I will assume it
works for you.&nbsp;<p>
Now, we know that your command works, now we have to work thru the
wonders of cron.  Let's double check that you *have* cron.  Type
<pre><font color="#FFFF00">crontab -l</font></pre>It should return something like 'no crontab for coffee' or
whatever your username is.  You should now edit a file, and make it
follow this form
<pre>
<font color="#FFFF00">Min hour day month * /home/username/bin/myfoo
</font></pre>
where in this case /home/username/bin/myfoo is a file with the contents
<pre>
<font color="#FFFF00">#!/bin/tcsh
/home/username/bin/rpost news &lt; /home/username/outfile
</font></pre>
where outfile is the file you wish to send.  Note that you must make
myfoo executable. To do this type <pre><font color="#FFFF00">chmod 755 myfoo</font></pre> in the same directory
as myfoo.  Ok, how about editing outfile to go to alt.test, and then
try <pre><font color="#FFFF00">exec tcsh;myfoo</font></pre> this should post a message to alt.test.  make
sure that you get it.  Now, lets say that it I want to send a test
message on 5/27 at 1:50 then the file 'cron' would look like
<pre>
<font color="#FFFF00">50 1 27 5 * ~coffee/bin/myfoo
</font></pre>
then one would simply run <pre><font color="#FFFF00">crontab cron</font></pre> and then wait until 1:50
and make sure that the post was actually sent.  By simply changing
file names around, hopefully this should make it easy to send a delayed
news posting.<p>

Everything that I've said works perfectly well for me.  The system
that this was tested on was based of slackware 3.2</p><p align="right">
