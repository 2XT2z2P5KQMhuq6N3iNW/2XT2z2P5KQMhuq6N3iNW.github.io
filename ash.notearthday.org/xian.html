<p>The Christian Church's condemnation of suicide stems largely from the teaching of two
theologians, St. Augustine of Hippo(1) and St. Thomas Aquinas(2).&nbsp; Both of these
theologians base their reasoning principally on the works of three pagan Greek
philosophers, Aristotle,(3)&nbsp; Socrates, and Plato (Aquinas in particular seems to hold
Aristotle in an almost sacrilegious adoration, referring to him as &quot;The
Philosopher.&quot;(4) </p>

<p>Augustine and Aquinas make brief, weak attempts to stretch the Sixth Commandment
(properly translated from the Hebrew as: &quot;Thou shalt not commit murder&quot;(5)) to
cover suicide, but for the most part rely on two principles: 

<ul>
  <li>Aristotle's proto-socialist outline for a virtuous (Pagan) society; </li>
  <li>the belief that individuals are the property of God(s) and the community (Aquinas
    explicitly compares the relationship of man and God to that of a slave and
    slaveholder).(6)</li>
</ul>

<p>Both also offer the oft-cited claim that suicide somehow violates God's exclusive
prerogative to decide the duration of one's life. Enlightenment philosophers Jean Jacques
Rousseau and David Hume(7) effectively disposed of these arguments, pointing out that,
carried to their logical conclusions, they would *obligate* suicide, when it was to the
community's benefit, and would prohibit any medical treatment as also interfering with
God-willed lifespans. </p>

<p>Aquinas goes on to argue that an obligation of charity and love for oneself precludes
suicide. Aside from beginning from an unsupported premise that all suicides stem from
self-hatred, Aquinas is inconsistent in this argument: when circumstances are such that
the loving and charitable act might be self-deliverance, Aquinas abandons these virtues
for the virtue of &quot;fortitude.&quot; </p>

<p>Finally, both Augustine and Aquinas deal with the uncomfortable facts that the Bible
*does* present the suicide of Samson as the act of a saint, and that the Church has from
its earliest days honored as saints certain Christians who, faced with persecution,
committed suicide, with an outrageous act of intellectual dishonesty: without any
Scriptural support whatsoever, they assert that God must have &quot;secretly
commanded&quot; these suicides, and no others. </p>

<p>The first comprehensive Christian-era legal code was the Code of Justinian.&nbsp; This
codex, drafted about a century after St. Augustine, did not punish suicide, if the person
had a good reason for killing himself; good reasons cited include, &quot;impatience of
pain or sickness, or by another cause, weariness of life... lunacy or fear of
dishonor.&quot;&nbsp; In short, every reason except no reason at all, and that was
punished only on the grounds that it was irrational: &quot;whoever does not spare himself
will not spare another.&quot;(8) Suicide did not become a crime under English Common Law
until the 10th Century, in the appropriately-named Dark Ages. England was the last
European nation to decriminalize suicide, in 1961, upon the advice of a committee
established by the Archbishop of Canterbury, ecclesiastical head of the Church of England.

<p>OLD TESTAMENT SUICIDES:</p>

<p>Abimelech (Judges 9:54), dying of a skull fracture during a siege, ordered his
armor-bearer to slay him, to avoid the ignominy of having been seen to have been killed by
a woman (she threw a millstone at him). </p>

<p>Samson (Judges 16:26-31) killed himself to avoid being &quot;made sport of&quot; by the
Philistines, after his capture and haircut, taking his tormentors with him. Samson's act
of Faith earned him a place among the saints (Hebrews, 11:32). </p>

<p>Saul (1 Samuel 31: 3-6), wounded and defeated in battle with the Philistines, asked his
armor-bearer to kill him. When the aide was afraid to do it, Saul fell on his own sword.
The armor-bearer then did likewise. </p>

<p>Achitopel (or Ahitophel, var. spellings) (2 Samuel 17:1, 23), plotted to overthrow
David. When his plan failed, he put his household in order and hanged himself. It is
interesting to note that the account specifies that he was buried in his father's
sepulchre, as opposed to the Christian Church's long history of refusing burial in
hallowed ground to suicides. </p>

<p>Zimri (1 Kings 16:18) usurped the throne of Israel; when he failed, he burned down the
palace around himself. </p>

<p>NEW TESTAMENT SUICIDES:</p>

<p>Jesus of Nazareth (all four Gospels) chose to aggravate the authorities into crucifying
him. Jesus was explicit in stating that his life was not being taken but that he was
voluntarily choosing death: &quot;No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of
myself.&quot; (John 10:18) Religious fundamentalists may insist that this doesn't amount
to suicide, but St. Augustine's tract opposing suicide was aimed at declaring the Donatist
sect (and other martyrdom-seeking sects) heretical, because the were in the habit of
goading magistrates, Pagan temple priests and other authorities into executing them,
secure in the knowledge that they would go to Heaven. </p>

<p>Judas Iscariot (Matthew 27:4-5) hung himself after betraying Jesus. Presented as an
appropriate act of contrition, generally (how would the Gospels look if they said,
&quot;And then Judas retired to the Mediterranean resort city of Caesarea and lived to a
comfortable old age&quot;?) </p>

<p>The Jailer at Philippi (Acts 16:26-29), under the mistaken impression that all his
prisoners had escaped during an earthquake, figured his career and life were in jeopardy
and prepared to fall on his sword. Paul stopped him, not arguing that suicide was wrong,
but merely that the jailer was acting under a misapprehension. </p>
