<p>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in the United States is a world-renowned
government-run research institute for the study and prevention of disease.&nbsp; This
institute has classified suicide as a disease and is spending lots of tax money to
&quot;prevent&quot; it.</p>

<p>Normally, disease prevention - as opposed to cure - is conducted by finding the causes
of the disease and eliminating the causes from the general population, by such means as
sanitation or vaccination.&nbsp; Curiously, however, suicide &quot;prevention&quot; is
carried out only when a &quot;symptom&quot; - such as an attempt - manifests itself.
&nbsp; There is no ongoing effort to provide the basic health care for physical and
scientifically-defined neurological disorders, let alone other necessities, which would
make suicide less of an optimal choice. What is called &quot;prevention&quot; with suicide
would be called &quot;treatment&quot; with any other syndrome classified as a disease.</p>

<p>When a &quot;disease&quot; manifests itself, the CDC will often rush to investigate it
no matter where in the world it occurs, in order to find out why it happened and how to
*prevent* it from happening again.&nbsp; I'm not holding my breath to see the CDC launch a
disease investigation into the US Small Business Administration and the US Department of
Justice in regards to the following..</p>

<font color="#FF0000">Defeated by foreclosure, two women gas themselves, their cats and dogs
Thursday, April 16, 1998

KALISPELL, Mont. (AP) -- Two women who lost an 11-year legal battle to save
their chicken farm were found dead with their cats and dogs, apparently
committing suicide just before federal marshals seized the property.

Thelma J. Lee, 67, and Maureen R. O'Boyle, 51, found with their 13 cats and
three dogs in a garage on the Naughty Pines Chicken Farm south of
Whitefish. They had been distressed about the loss of their property, which
had been bought at auction by the federal Small Business Administration,
Flathead County Sheriff Jim Dupont said.

Federal marshals who arrived to take possession of the farm April 7 found a
note from O'Boyle and Lee on the front gate, leaving their possessions to a
friend, and another on the door of the home saying the women thought they'd
found all the cats.

But the bodies were not found until a week later, when a friend discovered
them Tuesday in a garage. Dupont said the women asphyxiated themselves in a
pickup truck.

&quot;It was the most obvious case of suicide I've ever seen,&quot; Dupont said.

&quot;The truck key was on, the battery dead, and it was out of gas,&quot; the
sheriff said. &quot;There also were three dead dogs on the garage floor, 12 dead
cats in the bed of the pickup camper shell, and one dead cat in a shopping
cart in front of the vehicle.&quot;

When the notes were found the previous week, the federal marshals had asked
the sheriff's office to search the farm. Undersheriff Chuck Curry said he
and two deputies searched the house and numerous outbuildings, but decided
the women couldn't be in the garage. Hornets had built nests on the garage
doors, and the officers concluded &quot;no one had been in there since fall,&quot;
Curry said.

U.S. District Judge Charles Lovell had authorized the forced sale of the
farm for some $600,000 in unpaid loans. O'Boyle and Lee had consistently
argued they had been misled, lied to and coerced by bank and SBA officials
until they could no longer operate the organic chicken business. They shut
the business down several years ago.

On Dec. 11, 1996, on Lovell's orders, the farm was sold at public auction.
The sole bidder, the SBA, bought it for $1.2 million, including interest,
taxes and other liens. But the women continued to battle in court.

On Jan. 12, U.S. Attorney Sherry Scheel Matteucci wrote the women,
expressing sympathy but saying the foreclosure could not be appealed
further and they must leave. &quot;You need to move on to a new chapter in your
lives,&quot; she wrote.

Dupont said the women had been without electricity or hot water for at
least a couple of years.

&quot;They knew a lot of people, but they were loners,&quot; he said.

<p>I don't expect I'll be reading articles on the CDC subpoenaing SBA and bank records
anytime soon.&nbsp; What is the CDC really interested in? Prevention?&nbsp; NONSENSE.
&nbsp; That would cost way too much money.&nbsp; Intervention, imprisonment without trial,
and forced drugging of the people who attempt, fail, and are caught, is much more
cost-effective, and gets the CDC nice headlines as well.</p>
