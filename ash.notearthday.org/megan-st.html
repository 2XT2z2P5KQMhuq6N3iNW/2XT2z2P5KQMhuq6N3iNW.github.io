Um this is major rambling, it won't make sense..... don't try to make sense of 
it.</p>
<p>
Tell me why I'm immune to suicide?</p>
<p>
Why won't death capture me like it has captured so many of my loved ones?</p>
<p>
There's something wrong with me, I don't know what it is, but there is definitly 
something wrong.</p>
<p>
I feel this thought in my head take over me, as so many others have, but this 
thought is soooo powerful and so rational to me, I let it take over without any 
fight back.</p>
<p>
I sometimes want to die because I think it will make everyone know how serious I 
was about this.</p>
<p>
Maybe it will make my mom raise Zachary with more freedom, and less screams, 
maybe it will help David become a decent human being, maybe it will let you let 
go of me in the way you know you need to, maybe it will teach Jonny how fucked 
up all these drugs actually are, and how much I hate them, maybe Ruby will 
become more compassionate, maybe I will finally be free about worrying about 
them.</p>
<p>
Usally when I want to kill myself I'll be about to do it, and suddenly I'll 
think of my brother, growing up without a decent human being to show him open 
mindedness, or I'll think of Ray.... and how much he'd need me as much as I'd 
need him, then I think of people who hurt me, and I think it might be revenge if 
I stayed alive and made something productive of myself.</p>
<p>
But no matter what, I do believe I'll be dead within a year... and to say that 
is just as painful as to actually doing it. I know it's true in my heart, and 
nobody can convince me anything else. So I guess this is my good-bye I promised 
you, in case I'm not gonna wake up tomarrow. </p>
