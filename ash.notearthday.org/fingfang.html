        <p>This is my project file. I say things in here. After this is my plan
        file. It has depressing things i've said. It won't matter a fetid
        dingo's kidneys once I'm dead. This file also has depressing things I've
        said, but it has a little more structure. You probably finger(1)'d me to
        find out some stuff about me. I am usually funnier than this. Really-
        here a joke: I wonder if Data has a list of turn on's and turn off's.
        Well, most people don't think I am funny, but I do and I'm not most
        people. Most people aren't anywhere as depressed as I am. Most people's
        lives don't suck bad enough to give a black hole a run for it's money.
        Most people don't have to think about all the evil things I think about.
        Most people gawk at members of the opposite sex. Most people want to
        have kids. Most people's main goal in everyday existance is to have sex
        with a member of the opposite sex. Most people don't like me cause of
        the way I am. Most people can't deal with the concept of death. Most
        people belive in some sort of god. Most people think there is some good
        to be found in people. Most people don't sit in dark user centers
        writing depressing project files on X11 terminals. Most people arent
        nearly as quiet as I am. Most people have something of value to say to
        other people. Most people don't consider computers toys to be played
        with and discovered. Most people don't belive that suicide is a viable
        option. Ohwell, thats what I had to say about most people. I guess I am
        really not most people. Let me see if I can give a clue to what I AM:
        iam depressed, agile, longhaired, angstfull, averageheight, unfashonable,
        blueyed, quiet, introverted, silly, hairy, computertalented, tonedeaf,
        different, highmetabolism, brownhair, stronglegs, affectionate, asexual,
        thinkish, broody, badtyping, moody, nicknamed, russianborn, ritstudent,
        csmajor, bikechainbracelet, yuckyrealname, observant, socialmoron,
        philosophical, pessimistic, smellyfeet, nolife, alone, tired,
        unpolitical, pissedoff, hatebeer, badjokes, neversmoked, clever,
        unmotivated, nogoals, hatelife, childish, lovehack, wontgrowup,
        worrysome, defeatist, likemusic.</p>
        <p>Plan: Have a nice death \ Some people are alive because its illegal
        to kill them \ Life is for people who cant deal with suicide \ ignorance
        is bliss. knowledge is power. power corrupts \ Pessimists are what the
        optimists call the realists. Suicidals are what the pessimists call the
        real pessimists \ The reason they have no commercials saying &quot;Do
        Life&quot; is because dead people won't do comercials saying &quot;Do
        Death.&quot; \ Time waits for no man but death waits for all men \ The
        only reason I finished the project so fast is 'cause I haven't been to
        class in a week anahaf \ Pain is bad, death is good. It takes a while to
        appreciate the difference \ My life is pointless because I cannot be a
        god. My mind is a tough one to please \ Falling in love doesn't kill
        people. Landing does \ A death of a loved one can be very traumatic.
        luckily most sucidals have low self esteem \ The promise of death is the
        only thing keeping some people alive \ Taking ones life is hard when
        there is somebody one cares about \ To be great is to be misunderstood \
        Just one more hack before I have to go to bed, just one more... \ If you
        do it for you, it will be true \ Strength through mindlessness \ Shit:
        were all in it together \ Nice, selfless people don't restore my faith
        in humanity, they restore my faith in randomness \ If you are happy then
        you aren't thinking hard enough \ When things seem the best, it is time
        to worry most intensely</p>

        cry? Or will they just forget that I existed? Does it really
        matter?&quot;<br>
