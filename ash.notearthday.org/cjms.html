Was it a Dream</p><p>
I met you by chance, it just happened with a glance. I saw your beauty and
how you lit up a room, and only wished that I could find someone like you.
Never had I thought that you would look into me. Just thought it would end
in passing. You pulled me out of my shell, into the light that I have hid
from for so long. I trembled with fear, but couldn't resist your elegance
and confidence. I tried to hold back for as long as I could, but then I
embraced the light they everyone calls love. I gave you my heart and it felt
good. The way you looked and me and said, that you loved me, I will never
forget. My heart felt warm again, I felt full and consumed by a love that I
had only encountered once before. Then in the blink of an eye you were gone.
It was months, but feels like minutes. I gave you my all, and you just
handed it back to me when you were done. You words of love may have been
true, but the feel like daggers in my heart. After all the tears that I have
now cried, and the immense amount of pain that I feel I find it hard to
close my eyes. I lay my head and try to sleep, but memories of you are all I
see. Am I asleep? It feels like I am. My body lay still, and numb and the
memories flood through my brain like a raging river. I can't move I find it
hard to breath. My eyes start to burn, and emptiness sets in.  I pray this
is a dream, but I can't awake. Please let this be a dream! Awake, stop the
pain, please wake up!  Then as I role on to my side clutching my stomach, I
realize that it's not a dream. All that I felt was real once again. I wish
it all would end.
