Did you ever look at the gleaming edge of a blade and think to yourself, it
won't hurt,
maybe just a little.  Maybe like I'm pinching myself.  A small price to pay
for the end of 
pain that continues on, without end, without fulfillment, without hope. 
Three seconds, it 
couldn't take much longer than that, maybe four, then all that pain would
slowly drain 
away, gee I hope I don't stain the carpet.
</p><p align="center">
You know, it can't be so bad, it couldn't hurt that much.  It's really easy
enough to handle, 
I'm fine.  I suppose I'll survive,  that would be ironic.  Hey! I'll bet
that it's cleaner, and 
faster too, only have to do that once...  Just pull it, and it's done. I
hope they won't be 
mad, what am I saying, they don't care, of course they'll be mad.  I'll
fucking stain the 
carpet if I damn well please too.
</p><p align="center">
I wonder if I can tie that knot.  I heard that it's really fast, and even
cleaner.  I wonder if I 
can find something high enough to tie on to.  Maybe that branch in the
backyard.  But, 
wait a minute,  that wouldn't make a mess.  And I fucking want to stain the
fucking carpet.  
</p><p align="center">
Aww shit.  I dropped my grape juice, and damnit, I stained the carpet.
