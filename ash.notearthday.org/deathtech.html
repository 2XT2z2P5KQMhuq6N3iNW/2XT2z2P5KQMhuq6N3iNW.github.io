<p><font color="#FFFF00"><u><a name="Computer-Aided Decline (CAD)">Computer-Aided
Decline (CAD)</a><br>
</u></font><small>Some people, either wishing to separate themselves from
directly triggering death, or else wanting to do -everything- by computer, want
to have a computer somehow involved in their demise.&nbsp; In fact, CAD was the
means chosen in Australia for triggering the suicide machine which was
temporarily legalized (a program running under Microsoft Access asked if the
person was sure he wanted to die and, if yes was clicked, activated a servo to
release drugs down an IV).&nbsp; The simplest way for a person without access to
millions of research dollars to arrange for a computer signal to be translated
into mechanical action is to pick up a cheap dot-matrix printer
somewhere.&nbsp;&nbsp; Remove the case from around the working parts and you
have a mechanical triggering device which is simply operated by hitting a print
instruction on your computer.</small></p>
<hr width="30%">
<p><a name="Hammer Adjustment"><u><font color="#FFFF00">Hammer Adjustment</font></u></a><br>
<small>Another tricky problem is providing just the right amount of force on the
trigger of a firearm.&nbsp; Some may worry that the trigger is too much of a
hair-trigger to be really sure they want to fire, at the last; others find that
the trigger requires too much force for them to pull.&nbsp; In either case, the
hammer can be adjusted on many firearms to require either greater or lesser
force to pull it.</small></p>
<hr width="30%">
<p><a name="Shotgun methodology"><u><font color="#FFFF00">Shotgun methodology</font></u></a><br>
<small>The question of aim with a shotgun constantly arises. There are many
recorded instances of suicides failing where the shotgun is placed under the
chin; conversely, the author has heard of no instances where a shotgun barrel
placed fully in the mouth and slightly elevated, with the stock properly braced,
has resulted in the continued life of the would-be deceased.&nbsp; The infamous
&quot;Judas Priest&quot; suicides, where Raymond Belknap died but James Vance
survived, involved firing the shotgun under the chin - *not* in the mouth.&nbsp;
Mr. Belknap was evidence that under the chin -can- kill you; Mr. Vance was
evidence that under the chin can -fail-.&nbsp; (Eventually, Mr. Vance collected
enough painkillers to successfully suicide about three years after blowing his
face off.)</p>
</small>
<p><small>An anecdotal report was posted from a former operating room worker who
claimed to have assisted in the treatment of cases where she saw &quot;shot off
faces.. because the gun was in the mouth&quot;.&nbsp; Upon a request to provide
details or citations, however, all the poster could do was claim insult and
complain about people being mean, rather than provide any useful details or
reports to substantiate her claim.</small></p>
<p><small>Another anecdotal report was posted to the effect that someone who
placed the muzzle of a shotgun in the mouth, but -did not brace the stock-, had
the misfortune to have the shotgun slip - possibly due to expansion of gases -
resulting in the aim being transferred from the back of the head to up the
face.&nbsp; No details were provided in the <a
href="http://x8.dejanews.com/getdoc.xp?AN=427960152&amp;CONTEXT=915289492.895287402&amp;hitnum=1">post</a>
as to the name or location of the person who this happened to, making further
research difficult.</small></p>
<p><small>Some people suggest the heart as placement for a shot for instant
death; the problem here is exact location of the heart and not slipping one's
aim. A <!-- <a
href="http://x7.dejanews.com/getdoc.xp?AN=373086705&amp;CONTEXT=901393256.1362493600&amp;hitnum=0"> -->post<!-- </a> -->
 (previously linked here, but deja.com took older posts offline) to alc.suicide detailed one such attempt; while ultimately successful, it
certainly was not instant:</small></p>
<p align="center"><small><font color="#FF0000"><em>He shot himself in the heart
w/a 12 gauge shot gun, but it wasn't over instantly nor painlessly. He left a
blood stain that covered half of his bed then he managed to get up and walked to
his kitchen &amp; left his bloody hand print on a chair &amp; then walked back
to his bedroom &amp; side down his dresser to the floor where my other brother
found him 2 days later.</em></font></small></p>
<p align="left"><small>One anonymous poster has offered the following advice:</small></p>
<p align="left"><small><font color="#FF0000">You want to puree the
brainstem.&nbsp; The shotgun can throw a lot more destruction at the target than
a 9mm. Buckshot will do, but consider a turkey load:</font></small></p>
<ul type="square">
  <li><small><font color="#FF0000">they usually are even hotter than magnum buck</font></small></li>
  <li><small><font color="#FF0000">they won't overpenetrate as much. Your target
    is only a couple inches deep, from any direction. You want something that
    dumps its energy right there. The more energy the more puree. Remington
    makes a &quot;1375&quot; fps &quot;nitro-steel&quot; shell.</font></small></li>
</ul>
<hr width="30%">
<p align="left"><a name="How to Die by Lightning"><u><font color="#FFFF00">How
to Die by Lightning</font></u></a></p>
<ul>
  <small>
  <li>Be aware of weather forecasts during the thunderstorm season (generally
    May through September, in the US).</li>
  <li>Because lightning often precedes rain, preparations to attract potential
    lightning strikes should begin before the rain begins.</li>
  <li>When thunder is heard, avoid enclosed places. If possible, stand or sit
    near trees or tall objects because electricity may be conducted from that
    object to other nearby objects or persons.</li>
  <li>Other good places to be are high ground, water, and open spaces.</li>
  <li>Metal objects (e.g., golf clubs, umbrellas, fences, and tools) will also
    increase your chances.</li>
  </small>
</ul>
<p align="right"><small><em>-adapted from Preventing Deaths and Injuries from
Lightning Strikes, by the US CDC</em></small></p>
<p align="left"><small>According to the US' National Weather Service, personal
music devices like a Walkman &quot;can act just like a portable lightning rod. They are very dangerous to wear in 
a thunderstorm.&quot;</small></p>
<!-- Joe Miketta, Mount Holly Office, quoted in the Asbury Park Press, 8/8/2000 -->
<p align="left"><small>For the convenience of those in the US, the <a href="http://www.weather.com/">Weather
Channel</a> has thoughtfully provided a continuously updated <a href="http://www.weather.com/maps/activity/golf/uslightningstrikes_large.html">map
of lightning strikes</a> on the web.</small></p>
<hr width="30%">
<p align="left"><a name="Sources for materials"><u><font color="#FFFF00">Sources
for materials</font></u></a><br>
<small>Many items which are 'restricted' to certain purchasers through more
obvious methods such as pharmacies, are quite readily available through
industrial sources. To totally restrict these items would, in the course of
things, mean the total shutdown of modern industrial civilization.</p>
<p align="left">Remember, of course, when obtaining items from such sources,
that you need a decent story as to what you're doing with it.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Lithium Carbonate (pharmaceutical name Lithonate) - this can be obtained
    from artist type shops. It is used for the production of glazes. Don't ask
    for it as Lithonate in an art shop, of course..</li>
  <li>Large-Gauge needles - these can be obtained from taxidermist supply
    shops.&nbsp; One person has mentioned an online supplier who sends out a
    catalog, etc. no questions asked - <a href="http://www.vandykes.com/">Van
    Dykes</a>.</li>
</small>
<li><small>A post mentioned a web source for cyanide salts and solutions;
  however, the firm has been bought out, and the new company does not sell the
  items.</small></li>
</ul>
<hr width="30%">
<p align="left"><u><font color="#FFFF00">&quot;Easy&quot; <a name="OTC methods">OTC
methods</a> of dying</font></u><br>
<small>Another common question about suicide methods goes approximately like
this:</p>
<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000"><em>is there any way to relatively
painlessly, quickly, and/or reliably kill one's self using over-the-counter
drugs?</em></font></p>
<p align="left">In the USA, the Food and Drug Administration is charged with
ensuring the safety and effectiveness of drugs available to the populace at
large (similar agencies exist in most countries). By safety, it is meant that
the drugs should not wind up killing people easily. The greater the 'danger',
the more restriction. Thus, <font color="#FFFF00">any drugs sold in an
unrestricted manner, such as over-the-counter drugs, are those deemed to be very
safe; that is, they are drugs that will not likely kill you painlessly or
quickly</font>. Unless you are unusually susceptible to an OTC drug - or
allergic to one - the closest you are likely to come is acetaminophen (aka
Tylenol, Paracetamol), which is neither painless nor quick; death is, from all
reports the author has seen, certain to occur if intervention does not happen
within 120 hours; however, it usually takes at least two weeks of agonizing pain
to die, and has been known - with aggressive intervention on one person who
changed her mind a bit too late - to take two months of agonizing pain to die.</small></p>
<hr width="30%">
<p><u><font color="#FFFF00"><a name="US Firearms">US Firearms</a> Regulations
and other information<br>
</font></u><small>Firearms regulations in the United States of America vary from
state to state.&nbsp; In most cases, if you have a psychiatric or criminal
record you cannot obtain a firearm legally.&nbsp; Some states allow people with
a psychiatric record to obtain a firearm if they have a written statement from a
psychologist or psychiatrist that they do not pose a danger to themselves or
others.&nbsp; A comprehensive look at US firearms regulations is available on
the <a href="http://www.nraila.org/research/statelaws/">National Rifle
Association</a>'s website.</small></p>
<p><small>The Medical School of Wisconsin is in the process of compiling safety
information about different types of firearms.&nbsp; You can read about the ones
they have information on so far at their <a href="http://www.mcw.edu/fic/gunprofiles.html">website</a></small></p>
<hr width="30%">
<p><font color="#FFFF00"><u>Some technical details on <a name="hanging">hanging</a></u><br>
</font><small>The US Department of the Army, in Army Regulations No. 633-15
(Procedure for Military Executions) published 7 April 1959, provides some good
graphical tips on hanging procedures.&nbsp; The <a href="images/dropheit.jpg">drop
table</a>, from which the figures in the <a href="methods.html">a.s.h methods
file</a> were copied, is provided here in its original format, as are <a
href="images/ga1.jpg">diagrams</a> for two ways to make a portable gallows,
and the proper method for <a href="nooselinks.html">tying a noose.</a>&nbsp;
Another source page for how to tie nooses is <a href="http://www.realknots.com/knots/noose.htm#noose" target="_blank">Roper's
Knot Pages</a>.</small></p>
<p><small>A good technical discussion of the various ways people actually die by
when killed by hanging is available at <a href="http://emedicine.com/emerg/topic227.htm">http://emedicine.com/emerg/topic227.htm</a>.</small></p>
<hr width="30%">
<p><a name="Death by eating"><font color="#FFFF00"><u>Death by eating</u></font></a><br>
<small>The US Food and Drug Administration has kindly provided the world with a
list of foods that may be poisonous or even fatal at <a
href="http://vm.cfsan.fda.gov/~mow/intro.html">http://vm.cfsan.fda.gov/~mow/intro.html</a>.</p>
<hr width="30%">
</small>
<p><a name="Delayed Posting"><font color="#FFFF00"><u>Delayed Posting</u></font></a><br>
<small>Some people want to inform the world of their demise without giving the
world an opportunity to prevent that demise.&nbsp; Here is a <a href="delayedpost.html" target="_top">guide</a> to doing a delayed posting from a Linux shell
account (it should be mostly valid for any UNIX-type shell account).</small></p>
<hr width="30%">
<p><a name="Browser Cleanup"><font color="#FFFF00"><u>Browser Cleanup</u></font></a><br>
<small>If you want people not to be able to check which websites you've been
looking at when you don't have any more use for your computer, there is a
shareware program called <a href="http://www.webroot.com/down1.htm#WindowWasher">Window
Washer</a> which will erase your browsing tracks.  Don't
download and install it until you're ready to use it, it expires after 30 days.</small></p>
<hr width="30%">
<p><a name="Efficient Means"><font color="#FFFF00"><u>Efficient Means</u>
</font></a><br><small>By 'efficient means' is meant a method where there is
virtual certainty of death within five minutes or less of initiating the
procedure.&nbsp; This, of course, leaves out drug methods.&nbsp; Governments
being generally opposed to people dying whenever they want to, these methods can
be difficult to secure materials for as well.</small></p>
<p><small>Also, efficient means are concerned primarily with the goal-at-hand: </small><small><b>dying</b>.&nbsp;
Other conditions, such as ultimate corpse condition, are secondary to that.</small></p>
<p><small>The simplest, most efficient, but difficult-to-obtain method is high
explosives; a stick of dynamite or the equivalent in blasting power.&nbsp; This
is by far the best method for certain death; there is no worry about which part
of the brain gets destroyed, or varying body chemistry, when one's entire brain
is obliterated.&nbsp; A good source for DIY information is the newsgroup <a href="http://www.deja.com/dnquery.xp?QRY=alt.engr.explosives&amp;ST=MS&amp;svcclass=dncurrent&amp;DBS=2" target="_blank">alt.engr.explosives</a>.</small></p>
<p><small>The second most efficient method is via <a href="deathtech.html#Shotgun methodology" target="_top">shotgun</a>.&nbsp;
Efficiency in this method is dependent upon some practice with an unloaded
shotgun first, to ensure that proper aim (through the mouth, slightly elevated,
and with the stock braced against slippage) is achieved.&nbsp; Here, of course,
there is concern about hitting the brainstem, which is why a shotgun is
preferable to a handgun; but, if one is familiar with the location of the
brainstem relative to the back of the mouth, and does not rush preparations, the
chances for efficient completion approach certainty.</small></p>
<p><small>In some countries, it is difficult to legally obtain a shotgun; in
other countries, a mental health record often precludes obtaining one
legally.&nbsp; Thus, it's always a good idea to have a shotgun around, even if
one is not planning to use it, before any attempt which may result in a mental
health record.</small></p>
<p><small>The third efficient method is inhalation of cyanide fumes.&nbsp;
Unfortunately, as jewelry companies move away from cyanide solutions for
electroplating, cyanide is becoming more difficult to obtain.</small></p>
