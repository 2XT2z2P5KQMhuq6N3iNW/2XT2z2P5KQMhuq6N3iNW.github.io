<h1>Black Beauty</h1>
<hr align="left" width="50%">
<p>I have some relief now<br>
I have my black 45 in my hand<br>
A ticket to eternity now<br>
Beautiful lady, with great power over life and death<br>
take me away to a place where I have no pain<br>
no remorse, no afraid.<br>
Take me now with you<br>
Let me fly over my pain and go away<br>
very far, so far away<br>
Dear 45 lady take me in your arms<br>
like a lover, and love me, kiss me, hold me.<br>
I am not afraid...<br>
Take me with you<br>
and just go away..<br>

<h1>ONE CLOUD IN MY LIFE</h1>
<pre>

Some time ago I lost my sight.

No morning sun it's only night

There's a big black cloud

Always following me around.



It blocks the light, it brings the rain

It blocks my heart, it brings the pain

This big black cloud

Always following around.



The pain is sharp, as from a knife

I hate this pain, I hate my life

I hate this cloud

Alwas folloing me around



If I could cry, I'd let it out

If i could die, I'd be without

That big black cloud

Always following me around...

  <p>Webspinner's Note:</b> Due to E-mail correspondence with another ASH poster
  pointing out the similarity between the above and another, older, poem, <i><a

<h2>A Goodbye?</h2>
<p>Webspinner's note on posting these lines: I received this in my E-mail this
weekend. This, and two other letters by the same author. I don't know that these
will end up being the last that the author writes. Perhaps he can find the
release in writing that I have found. Perhaps enough even to stick around
another day. If not, I wish him well and a peaceful journey.</p>
<hr align="left" width="20%">
<pre>Last one...

&quot;When I was born everybody smiles and I cry, 
but when I die everybody cry and I smile&quot;
