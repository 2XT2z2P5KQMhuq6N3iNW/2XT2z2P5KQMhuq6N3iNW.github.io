<h3 align="center"><font color="#FF0000"><b>Thoughts At Heathrow Bar</b></font></h3>
<P align="center">As I lay me down to sleep<br>
(as I know I surely will)<br>
Twelve thousand miles away  - you're there, for the moment<br>
And that makes the score 10 - nil.</P>
<P align="center">Having been atop the Eiffel Tower<br>
Having seen St Peters in Rome<br>
Having seen art, and culture, and beauty<br>
More beautiful was you, at home.</P>
<P align="center">Now you won't speak to me<br>
You won't let me say goodbye<br>
You fly away the day I fly in...<br>
So without you, I'm coming home to die.</P>
<P align="center">In Rome I toasted the city<br>
On the Alps I toasted Steve<br>
But when you weren't on that gondola in Venice<br>
I could not toast, I grieved.</P>
<P align="center">I've been called a fool (and worse) before<br>
Because of what I feel for you<br>
But when one has found perfection<br>
What else could I do?</P>
<P align="center">I scoured half the civilized world<br>
and spared absolutely no resource<br>
to find a girl better than you, but there is none<br>
If anything, that point was only reinforced.</P>
<P align="center">My last three quid's gone on Heineken<br>
It's all I can now afford<br>
Killing time till they call my flight<br>
Half drunk, lonely, broke, and bored.</P>
<P align="center">It's been a holiday to remember, all right!<br>
Robbed in Paris by 3 goons and a sack<br>
The exchange rate's looking really sad these days<br>
Penniless and ego injured, it's time to go back.</P>
<P align="center">Counting down the minutes <br>
Till it's farewell to this England<br>
Time to go home where one belongs<br>
And give Fate a helping hand.</P>
<P align="center">In a fornight's time<br>
You'll be arriving in this place<br>
And what I can only aspire to <br>
You'll handle with style and grace.</P>
<P align="center">So I wish you all the best, my love<br>
Although I am not yours.<br>
You'll be the ray of sunshine here<br>
Even while the heavens open up, and it pours.</P>
<P align="center">I hope no tragedy strikes this flight<br>
and the plane lands safely on the ground,<br>
I'll do what I must, by my own hand<br>
And what's mine is yours, D, when I'm not around.</P>

<h3 align="center"><font color="#FF0000"><b>When There's Nothing Left To Lose</b></font></h3>
<P align="center">To fight the good fight,<br>
To try and do what's right,<br>
Somehow, it's never enough.<br>
i still feel like shit<br>
Quite a lot, not a bit<br>
and what's more - i don't give a stuff.</P>
<P align="center">The future's the same <br>
And playing this game <br>
Is only reliving the past.<br>
i got given life<br>
i got got given strife<br>
Neither for which did i ask.</P>
<P align="center">To continue this farce<br>
Is a pain in the arse<br>
And an exercise in total futility<br>
Better to to out <br>
On top, without doubt<br>
Then succumb to old age and senility.</P>
<P align="center">Rather than fall into disgrace<br>
i can get out of this place<br>
and i'm reserving the right to choose<br>
What little that mattered<br>
Is all tarnished and battered - <br>
Because there's nothing here left to lose.</P>
<P align="right"><i>Sometime, 2001</i></P>
<hr width="30%">
<h3 align="center"><font color="#FF0000"><b>Reflections</b></font></h3>
<P align="center">I see a face in the mirror,<br>
it looks a little bit like me<br>
i think what i've become<br>
i don't like what i see. </P>
<P align="center">you gave me hope of something better,<br>
then you flood my world with tears<br>
my hate and spite are good companions <br>
living in my house of fear. </P>
<P align="center">i hate you, but i hate me more<br>
i hate what i've become,<br>
because of you, in spite of you,<br>
i am empty, cold and numb. <br>
 <br>
a shell exists where someone lived,<br>
the hollow sounds inside<br>
empty laugher, reverberating<br>
at the false illusion of my pride. </P>
<P align="center">the tie goes on, around my neck,<br>
the suit is pressed and clean.<br>
the sweet smell of the aftershave <br>
masks the smell of where i've been.</P>
<P align="center">The sunglasses hide the eyes<br>
the tinted windows hide the rest. <br>
in the office, the house, the open air -<br>
i can't hide from what i detest. </P>
