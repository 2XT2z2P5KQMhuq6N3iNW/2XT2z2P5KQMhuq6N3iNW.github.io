and recovery? That's nice. Go away now, please.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="meredith.html">The Emotional Risks of ASH</a><br>
Those in society who dehumanize the suicidal in so many ways also do so by insisting that
just because we support self-determination in suicide, we also must not 'feel' any sense
of loss when someone succeeds.&nbsp; Guess again.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="purple.html">The Strength of Community</a><br>
A common accusation by trollers and preachers is that alt.suicide.holiday, by its very
existence, makes suicide more likely.&nbsp; Time to debunk another unfounded myth that's
propagated by psychological and religious control freaks.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="donottell.html">Do Not Tell Me...</a><br>
Some people think &quot;positive thinking&quot; cures all.&nbsp; Such people have never

</i>So, you're seized by an overwhelming desire to &quot;help&quot; the poor
suicidals by having us dragged away to a hospital for forced treatment?&nbsp;
How original..&nbsp; Are you willing to &quot;help&quot; with the damn bills,
too, or is your idea of help to actually cause &#150;more&#150; pain?</p>


<p align="center"><a href="second.html">Read This Second<br>
</a>
There's a widely-indexed suicide-prevention page,
"Suicide: read this first", on the World Wide Web.&nbsp; If you've read it, and it seemed rather trite, impersonal,
and not really helpful, maybe this will help you get some
of your thoughts together.</p>


<p align="center"><a href="dismissal.html">The Western Dismissal</a><br>
There's lots of people out there who &quot;care&quot;.&nbsp; &quot;Care&quot; in
Western Civilization usually consists of fobbing difficult people off on other
people with words of &quot;caring&quot;, such as &quot;You should go talk to
someone&quot; (but oh gods not me - i don't have the time!)</p>

<p align="center"><a href="reasonsto.html">45 Reasons Why Suicide May Not Be Such a Bad Idea After All</a><br>

<p align="center"><a href="blame.html">Blaming the Unlucky<br>
</a>To escape the notion that everyone is likely to have ill fortune at some
time or another, people seem to feel the need to declare that the unlucky
brought their misfortune upon themselves.&nbsp; Commentary from an asher
diagnosed with cancer on this need by the healthy and fortunate to curse the
unfortunate.
</p>

<p align="center"><a href="sidhe.html">The Not So Good Earth</a><br>
What is &quot;normal&quot;?&nbsp; And does it matter?&nbsp; We all wind up in
the same place anyway.

<p align="center"><span lang="en-us"><a href="laurah.html">the pain no-one else 
will acknowledge</a><br>
Others in society say that a person who is totally consumed by the pain of 
existence has no reason to die.&nbsp; In doing so, they add to the pain and 
alienation and increase the need to suicide.</span></p>

<p align="center"><span lang="en-us"><a href="recourse.html">Suicide: the Recourse of the Selfless</a><br>
Suicide is often referred to as being the ultimate act of selfishness.&nbsp; In 
fact, it's often the <i>first</i> act of selfishness - when one is worn down by 
constantly putting everyone's needs and expectations ahead of one's own needs.</span></p>
