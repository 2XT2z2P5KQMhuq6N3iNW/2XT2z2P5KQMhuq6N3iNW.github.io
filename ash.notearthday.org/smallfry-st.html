<p class="item-title">Why live</p>
<p align="left">I was a think that was talking about how other people have had experiences in 
there life with suicide, and I just thought I would share my little story 
about my two closest friends, although I am still young I have seen two too 
many death A pound my youth. </p><p>
In elementary school I had two best friends a guy and a girl, we were inseparable. Tell out family problems grow to much, my female friend (whose 
name was amy) moved to California, my male friend (named Ryan) moved only 4 
hours up north, but those 4 hours were so far away for me. Life went on we 
talked less and less, it burned and hurt inside, I called amy on the phone 
every Saturday, we would talk for hours.one day when amy came to visit we 
talked about having a joint suicide, we thought it would be the perfect escape we
planned it all out. The day the year the time, and place and how to 
do it. We promised to do it on that day together. </p><p>
A few weeks later I was talking to amy on the phone, we got in a 
little fight and I said "why don't you just die" and I hung up the phone. I 
didn't call amy the next Saturday and she didn't call me, I waited but no 
phone call, the next week on Friday I got a call from her house, but it was 
not Amy, it was her sister. She told me Amy had hung herself in the back 
yard. I didn't believe her. Why would amy do it without me, why? I was so angry at amy for the longest time. Then I released she had but no choice. I 
still plan to do my suicide on the day me and amy had planned but this time 
Ryan will join me. And soon we will all be together again.
