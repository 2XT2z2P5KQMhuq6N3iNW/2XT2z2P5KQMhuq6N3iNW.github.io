I was trying to get away from the two girls, who were
working in the office with me, but they followed me to
my street, and now they were right behind me climbing
the stairs. Still i was trying to stop them, i thought
that even now, that we were so close to my room, i
could get them to go away. I was so sad, i was
thinking about my plight all the way and was utterly
convinced that i should make one final attempt to
prevent them from getting any closer, so i stopped
moving. They didnt expect me to stop, were right
behind me and the one fell on my back. I tried to say
what i had in mind but when i looked at her face i
uderstood that she was making fun of me, and wouldnt
listen to reason. She pushed me and so i was forced to
start moving again. After that we went inside my room.
They stood on one end of it, near the door, which
remained open. I stood on the opposite side, and the
closed window was between us. There was a reason why
we occupied that space of the room; the rest was full
of junk. There was a mountain of clay, rags and other
junk, and i was looking at it. I didnt want anyone to
come inside my room because of what lived there. I was
looking at the castle, made out of clay, which was at
the top of the pile. There i saw again the little
figure that dwelled in it, a disgusting little man,
who now started moving towards the girls, and appaled
them. "I share my room with him" i told them, while
they were leaving.</p>
