<p align="center">it was aloneness from the beginning<br>
that brought me to that utterly desolate place<br>
that crashed against those bare walls<br>
echoing the howling, inhuman lullaby<br>
which became my nightly companion</p>

<p align="center">that filled my belly twice<br>
with the seed of the one I needed<br>
to perpetuate my solitude</p>

<p align="center">aloneness that slammed me so deep within<br>
I welcomed the company of roaches<br>
who shared my bed at night<br>
indifferent to the holes they made<br>
gnawing milk from the faces of my sleeping babes</p>

<p align="center">that spread my legs for men lost in darkness<br>
wanting only to shove some part of themselves<br>
into something white</p>

<p align="center">aloneness that held my spirit<br>
in a body that longed for gruesome end<br>
but would not suffer it's offspring<br>
cohabitation with it's rotting corpse<br>
darkened finally in a bath<br>
of high voltage.</p>

<hr width="25%">

<h3 align="center"><font color="#FF0000">Given to Pain</font></h3>

<p align="center">i've never been a fighter...a fighter... a fighter<br>
the echo did not fade<br>
but continued for years<br>
unfolding into a life<br>
of complacency.</p>

<p align="center">there was a doctor<br>
shouldered by a nurse<br>
peering at deformity<br>
and four more of them to hold<br>
one flailing, forgotten child</p>

<p align="center">there were tubes to be removed and cleaned<br>
and nosebleeds<br>
and nosebleeds<br>
and arm splints<br>
and when i writhe<br>
not to worry, he says,<br>
babies don't feel pain</p>

<p align="center">and now i'm floating<br>
in a sea of stars<br>
far from the needle and the blade<br>
and the bones broken<br>
in his experiment called surgery<br>
to be repeated every few months<br>
for years</p>

<p align="center">they say i am retarded<br>
but it is my disdain they misinterpret<br>
i have learned to stay away<br>
i gave my body to the pain<br>
but the stars,<br>
the stars are mine</p>

<hr width="30%">

<p align="center">Autism<br>
is the word<br>
for spirit not wholly present</p>

<p align="center">it is these lucky ones<br>
who find the world lacking<br>
and retreat back through<br>
the warmth of the womb<br>
and into the eternal</p>

<hr width="30%">

<p align="center">
Love is a sea<br>
deep and clear and warm.<br>
Nothing like those murky swamps<br>
where you loose your shoes<br>
if you're not careful.</p>

<hr width="30%">

<p align="center">Calling all angels<br>
Calling all angels</p>

<p align="center">you there in asylums<br>
dreaming your wasted dreams<br>
and you at the sink, razor in hand,<br>
the drunk and the junkie, the holy whore<br>
those of you nursing the tit of death wish<br>
who've lost hope cause you once knew that hope did exist<br>
the stars in your eyes by pain extinguished<br>
laid open and bleeding at the lack of love<br>
the world still mourns<br>
the loss of your light.</p>

<p align="center">Calling all angels<br>
Calling all angels</p>

<p align="center">you with the audacity to think differently<br>
ostracized for differences of form and thought<br>
who see into the subtle and hear gentler voices<br>
you discontent at the side of injustice<br>
it is you who find the world not worth saving<br>
who have draped the grace and power of revolution<br>
round bloodied wings now drooping.</p>

<p align="center">Unfold your light<br>
Unfold your light</p>

<p align="center">for it is only your song<br>
which saves the world<br>
from its unconscious hell.</p>
