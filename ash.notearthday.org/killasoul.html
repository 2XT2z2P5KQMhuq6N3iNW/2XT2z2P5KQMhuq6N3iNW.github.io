<p class="item-title">A Decision to Die.</p>
<p>I sat there in English class.  Both books open.  Trying to listen to the 
Professor as she mumbled incoherently about forming a good thesis, and 
definition of something or other.  But it wasn't her, it was me.  For in 
between her fragments and comma splices, whispering antagonistically in my 
head was the quote from Saul Bellow, in an early draft of HERZOG, "Don't cry, 
you idiot! Live or die but dont poison everything...."  So I gave in.  Break 
time and I gathered up my belongings and walked carelessly to my car, 
apologizing to myself for wasting the $300 on a class I knew I wasn't going 
to be around to finish anyway.  So there it was.  Tuesday, April 13, 1999, 
approximately 9:07 PM, I sat parked in my car at a kids park, drinking the 
home made cocktail of 4 boxes of unisom and a newly prescribed bottle of the 
antidepressant, Trazodone, which by the way as you can see doesn't work.  I 
had one intention and one intention only at this point in my life, thought 
out both rationally and philosophically....and that was to die.
</p><p>
The decision to commit suicide did not come hastily.  To begin with I used my 
God-given, life-expierencing, very own rationale.  According to Websters 
NewWorld Dictionary.</p><p><i>"RATIONALE: the ability to reason logically, as by 
drawing conclusions from inferences and often connotes the absence of 
emotionalism."</i></p><p>"All right so I stole it form a dictionary."  Regardless I 
used it.  I thought about life without using my emotions.  I thought about 
people who pick their noses while driving in cars on the highway and then act 
as if no one can see them.  I thought about turtles without shells and it 
must suck to be naked and homeless all at once.  I thought about being a 
small kid and not being able to protect myself from all the bigger people.  I 
thought about God and how he created and then walked away, murmuring 
something about how HE has forgiven US.  I thought about how, if even humanly 
possible, I could forgive him.  Then I thought about death.  That "thing" 
that lingers over us like our very own shadow, that strange "thing."  And 
while thinking about this "thing," it dawned on me.  It wasn't my shadow 
anymore.  It no longer attached itself to my feet and trolleyed behind me, in 
front of me, nor on my sides, somehow, someway, when I wasn't paying any 
attention "it" crawled right on up inside me. "It" rearranged the spaces 
inside my brain to fit itself in..and slowly it consumes me.  "It 'didn't 
need my emotion. "it" didn't need my inner most feelings.  All "it" needed 
were my thoughts, my experiences, but most of all..it needed my reasoning. 
Death understands.  Death knew what I thought, how I reasoned.  Death knows 
what rationale is, and knows just when and how to use it.  When one decides 
rationally to commit suicide, then one must find a way to justify that act of 
committing suicide.  I have learned that most that think about suicide tend 
to blame others for their suicidal thoughts, attempts or actual death.  Here 
are some examples:  1.  My parents are too hard on me, I just cant hang 
anymore. 2. My spouse is an idiot, I just cant do it anymore.  or my 
favorite.  3. Life just sucks!  Yes, now that's it...lets just blame it on 
the whole entire world.  Utterly ridiculous.  Now like I said, one rationally 
decides, to partake in ending the  life one has given you, one needs to 
justify this act.  Yes, I did this.  And I thought about putting the blame on 
others.  But I rationally thought how unfair that would be.  So I brought 
Philosophy into it.  I slept with Kierkegarrd, played with Nietzsche and 
toiled with Sartre.  I learned who we are all ill creatures, how man is the 
most vicious animal of all, and learned that I was no superman.  And then I 
read it.  I found the justification I was looking for.  The black and white 
writing that put everything into its proper perspective, and it ended with 
this:
</p><p>
<i><font color="#FFFF00">
" How unwillingly we think of things which powerfully injure our interests, 
wound or pride, or interfere with our wishes, with what difficulty do we 
determine to lay such things before our intellects for careful and serious 
investigations....in that resistance of the will to allowing what is contrary 
to it to come under the examination of the intellect lies the place at which 
madness can break upon the mind...if the resistance of the will against the 
apprehension of some knowledge reaches such a degree that the operation is 
not performed in its entirely, then certain elements or circumstances become 
for the intellect completely suppressed, because the will cannot endure the 
sight of them; and then, for the sake of the necessary connections. the gaps 
that thus arise are filled up at pleasure; thus madness appears.  for the 
intellect now imagines what does NOT exist. yet the madness, which has thus 
arisen, is the lethe of unendurable suffering, it was the last remedy of 
harassed nature, i.e.., the will.  the final refuge is suicide."</font></i></p><p>
and there it was.  the decision to commit suicide using rationale and this 
act justified philosophically  and with all in place, what more can be done?  
 acceptance of the consequences that will fooolwo.  and whether one fails or 
gets it right there will be consequences.  and i will name just a few.  
Depending on ones beliefs., if one succeeds in the act of suicide, there is a 
God to then deal with. and most likely he will be an angry God.  spending 
your lunch money on candy at the corner store instead of actually lunch when 
in 3rd grade would not compare to the anger this father would most likely 
feel towards you after you destroy what he has given to you, your life.  But 
if your an Atheist, the it dont really matter you'll just turn into a big 
ball of energy and end up floating around somewhere anyway, but what is worse 
then both of those put together is this...."PEOPLE". Now if one fails at 
suicide (which I think is worse than any angry God or a being a big ball of 
gas mind you) is that one then has to deal with "people."  People who want to 
stick you with needles, cut your clothes off, and they dont care if you just 
bought them for your death.  People whose jobs it is to stick tubes down your 
nose and throat and then get pissed at you because you throw up all over 
them.  People.  And for all you blamers out there...there is the people who 
started you thinking about suicide in the first place!  But I accepted this 
anyway.  And after this rational decision, the philosophical justifying of it 
and the acceptance of the consequences.  I have come to the conclusion...that 
next time I think I will jump!

<h2>September 19, 2000</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Century Gothic&quot;">&nbsp;I
wonder if you can hear the unsaid clearly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I doubt it because you cant even see the unseen at all Dr.Brownalthough
today we were closeyour acting like a teenage adolescent, like one of kahi
patients, thinking he was invincible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But
Dr. Brown, I dont existtherefore I AM!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I am a God and I have quit gathering myselfs in like cut flowers and
asking them how they are and where have they all been<o:p>

lose the earth you know, for greater knowing; to lose the life you have, for

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Century Gothic&quot;">It is
called waiting on the edge.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Dr
Brown hear me now, in my hand lies unblessed a black rosary, though you cant see
it, and I am an unbeliever.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Permit
me this grace, this crossing over, submerged in my own past and apparently my
own madnessI think only my hands are alive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I want to feel your mouth touch mineto breath life into me?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Yea right!<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Century Gothic&quot;">Closer
and closer comes the hour of my death as I rearrange my face and unravel
undeveloped.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I have entered a
strange place without words...its funny without words one may be handed bread.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>My tender physician I am in this domain of silence, the kingdom of the
crazies and the sleepers who sail over a terrible hardness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Twenty weeks or twenty days ill cross toward it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I am 27 hours out where night goes on forever and I think it sucks that
God has peeled my life back to its original start!<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Century Gothic&quot;">In one
hand Dr. Brown I will now have to hold my silence from you.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There will be no track for you to follow anymore. Only
a peculiar waiting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There will be
nothing to pick up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There will be
nothing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We inhabit here, number by
number pushed in and out like a needle, and I will inherit the darken...calling
it like a Jew at the pearly gates and you will inherit my journal.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Century Gothic&quot;">The
mirror...i look in my eyes like two shadows, like that of sparrows, the do no
age.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The smile, all wit, all charm,
invincible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The face, I wish I
could pull all the roots out of it and find her, how can they say she is me and
I am her part...YUK.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And just where
the hell is she anyway???<o:p>

</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Century Gothic&quot;">I keep
hearing the same message,  who cares about you, who cares. No one has ever
seen me explode like a pistol.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>NO
one has actually seen me fall apart, or come undone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Century Gothic&quot;">A
strange place this odd home, where my face sits in my hands so full of distance,
so full of an immediate fever.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Once
the Romans believed that noon was the ghost hour, but its not noon, its the
night with a full moon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They enter
and say, your bones are lovely, and before their strange hands I had that
already formed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Let your body in,
let it tie you in, in comfort...standing still at the doors, they are so full of
themselves, like white stones.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Yes
I have the instructions.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Century Gothic&quot;">Thought
I never touched, after the tequila and southern comfort, the drugs and bled the
red bloodin the morning I vomited outside behind the glass sliding door.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I heard a hyena laugh out of nowhere.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Will it be today that we argue and shout about how YOUR LOSS IS
GREATER THAN MINE! YOUR PAIN IS MORE VALUABLE! or will today our skins meet
delicately in the hold, fastened together in an intricate lockand will one of
us shout MY NEED IS MORE DESPERATE!<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Century Gothic&quot;">I
would touch you Dr.Brown.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Your
pulse brooding under your shirt, each shoulder well built, your arms, thin
birches, the white teeth, the tongue that has never met meso I will speak of
your eyes, each colored iris, and the quick pupils that follow intently.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Eyes can be ruined by mercy and lustand the heat, the heat
can undo itself, everyone undoes themselves at one time or another, everyone has
walked naked.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>How strange that you
are so tender Dr. Brown, I wonder f you are human.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>If you have excitable muscles, and a ripe neck where its sensitive toward
the underside of the jaw, and have you ever had to grit your teeth arch your
back and pushing in and pulling back fighting it, grabbing the hands, and
intertwining the fingersits all in the breathing remember, eyes half open,
shadows move along the wall...yea I wonder what it would be like if you were
human.<o:p>

<h2>September 23, 2000</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Century Gothic&quot;">I love
you too much David, and only this morning your body sat before me with its
shoulders gathered out like a Greek chorus-both of us coiled in this slippery
life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That was this morning, but
this is now and I sit alone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You
have a tongue that comes from your lips, half animal and half bird you say
caught in the doorway of your heart.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Yesterday I started following your rules, making the priorities right,
passing by your red veins and blue veins, my hands down your backbone, hands
between the legs where you display your inner knowledge.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Last night I watched your face after love, close the pillow, half-asleep
besides me, while my fingers drew little lines on your chest, while my fingers
tried to touch your cheeks, while I drew I LOVE YOU on your arm, as I
whisperedhey wake up and you mumbled  shhhh, im tired!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Two days ago I told you a little known grotto...several.were people that
are not hallucinations but are very real.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
entered into their domain wondering if again I could.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>THEY let their bodies lose, all their loneliness or what ever it truly is
called, they did not mind, it had nothing to do with me personally.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I calmly trailed over them, all adultstoday I showed you what I had
told you, as water so clear you could read a book through it, but now I know
that water is a strange thing that sits only on a tongue as in a deep womb.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>You have given me a new grotto, where every color again is black and
white; you say, look! You are a liar! Look! You fucked me over whore! Look!
You can not be trusted! Although I never touched. I was only the taker of
pictures.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My eyes once again shut
down ashamed again, as you take my car keys and become my keeper again telling
me  I have to sort out my feelings<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Century Gothic&quot;">After
all this, after hearing all the years of this. And these are the words that ring
aloud in my head, screaming like a toll bellDavid you should have been
careful for what you have wished for, again I sit here dumbfounded and confuses
and again having to you...apologize for something you wanted.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Century Gothic&quot;">I
think I suffer according to the digits of my hate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>David why dont you give me a report of the condition of my soul?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>David, why dont you give me a complete statement of my actions?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Number my sins on the Grocery list so I can see.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Its funny for some strange reason I cannot walk on water.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Your silence makes me a clairvoyant, this silence always
leads in the assistance of my death in one way or another but its something you
cant ever see as you walk out of the room ending the argument with a typical
fuck you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I was left alone,
quite alone and using up the darkness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
rolled up into a ball on the couch and there I went to bed...I really do need a
stand in for God I think.<o:p>

the horizon slowly bleeds itself and goes out of sight, and I wonder about this
lifetime with myselfI could as the sky but I would rather ask the first star.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Why am I here?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Why do I live
in this house?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Who is responsible?
Eh?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then the darkness, as black as
a bruise and the boy is here, sitting in the chair on the back porch with me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I wonder if I talk to him, if I would be talking to God in someway, I
mean he is dead and this is how it went:<o:p>

</span>Unusually awkward to walk, it is without grace, and there is no
rhythmnope you wouldnt fit it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Its
cool now how everyone is finally starting to see that an artery of this soul has
been severed and this soul is beginning to bleed all over them, messing up their
clothesselfbe careful with your words, even your sick, premeditated, what
you think to be miraculous ones.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Fuck
you self! This time they wont fail me, I have too much I want to say and no one,
I mean NO ONE can stop me now...self but you know that words arent good
