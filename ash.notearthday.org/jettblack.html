How much of me have I invented?<br>
How much of me becomes real?<br>

I know that you dream, too.<br>
We all crave to die inside.<br>

Suicide<br>
We all crave to die<br>
sometimes<br>
And if only we could...<br>
Yes, if only we could!<br>
it takes too much patience<br>
to be so good<br>
but no!<br>
I won't change...<br>
No, I never, never would<br>
Forgive the past mistakes<br>
Even though they tell me I should<br>
Forget the future<br>
Forever is so misunderstood<br>
Relax into me,<br>
Let me set you free<br>
One last breath, and the End<br>
I swear will come as a friend<br>

<p align="center">To You, oh, Moon of mine,<br>
so full and bright<br>
do I now extend my gaze.<br>
My mortal eyes drawn<br>
but with merely human wonder.<br>
Could it be more, perhaps?<br>
Could I possess a perception<br>
beyond the constraints<br>
of decaying flesh and bone?<br>
I stare and I wonder,<br>
marveling at your infinite beauty.</p>
<p align="center">Would that I, too,<br>
could exist as you exist --<br>
to know this world from only<br>
a Nocturnal point of view;<br>

an evening subdued by an<br>
absence of abundant light,<br>
to focus upon the sanctuary of<br>
heightened sensuality as<br>
shadowed upon the savory flesh of<br>
feline teenage faces<br>
and of those, too, whom<br>
we speak of in whispers and<br>
hush up in legend.</p>

<p align="center">Striking a flame to and evil I<br>
both love and despise<br>
I gently draw closed the heavy door<br>
of my empty apartment-home<br>
And climbing five...<br>
six...seven stairs alone<br>
along a windswept corridor<br>
up &amp; up<br>
to a barren balcony overlooking<br>
nothing....<br>
merely the drab exterior of brick masonry<br>
I sigh and slide my hollow shell down<br>
against a paved wall<br>
down to the haphazardly raked<br>
cement floor of this landing</p>
<p align="center">Je fume....</p>
<p align="center">Clove tobacco snaps and crackles<br>
anxiously through its thin paper walls;<br>
much like the words we knew together.<br>
The filter darkens rapidly, and I cease<br>
my vacant stares into the nothing<br>
to see it smoking in an eerie spiral,<br>
my body &amp; soul<br>
whirling in a ghastly, yet comfortable<br>
pain!<br>
My days are numbered<br>
(or so I am told).<br>
As empty as they are, I concede<br>
they are numb, and must be growing smaller<br>
with each drag that I inhale,<br>
staring callously out into the wind<br>
that passes me by<br>
once again.</p>
<p align="center">Taking it all in<br>
so much more slowly<br>
this time<br>
I hope to savour this<br>
uncharitable despair<br>
ashes flee like ants from the rain<br>
to the ever so cold cement below<br>
carried away quickly<br>
on this wind that mocks me<br>
continuously.</p>
<p align="center">Je fume...</p>
<p align="center">the umpteenth drag,<br>
and as always,<br>
I hold it in again<br>
waiting for what?<br>
I don't know...<br>
And yet again,<br>
I lose the heat my heart<br>
wishes to steal back inside.</p>
<p align="center">Reaching out now,<br>
I grapple to hold onto<br>
an iron railing<br>
I need now to move on,<br>
to look away<br>
I need so badly to think and feel clearly<br>
in fact to even see clearly<br>
but I cannot.<br>
I can see and feel.......<br>
nothing.</p>
<p align="center">Reeking and exhausted,<br>
alone and afraid<br>
I rise again<br>
descend these<br>
seven stairs again<br>
only to re-enter<br>
my empty apartment home<br>
alone.</p>

<p align="center">Heavy fog hangs about<br>
motionless<br>
among these many engraved stone markers.<br>
Somehow, I understand completely<br>
the grave significance<br>
of all these finely carved stones,<br>
and that tonight, a fresh grave<br>
waits to receive the corpse<br>
of someone known to me.<br>
This hand holding my hand above<br>
my head in a warm<br>
somewhat familiar grasp<br>
belongs to my mother,<br>
I believe.<br>
Apparently, she grieves<br>
though, of this, I am not convinced<br>
nor certain.<br>
My steady line of vision<br>
casts its gaze only<br>
upon the pale moon-light<br>
reflecting off of a few<br>
close headstones,<br>
through the sparse patches<br>
of grass softly embedded<br>
into the soil beneath our feet,<br>
and through the light fog, now and again.<br>
All I really know is that I am at last<br>
conscious, and focused to the point<br>
that I know that<br>
I am here<br>
if only for this singular moment.<br>
I absorb the beauty of this brief awakening,<br>
the quiet, damp cold<br>
of darkness.<br>
The moon is radiant<br>
and I feel invigorated by the evening air;<br>
comfortably at home<br>
not just here inside the cemetery gates,<br>
rather in the presence of death<br>
as it passes by<br>
and I...<br>
am not alone.</p>

<table width="70%"><tr><td width="100%">
<p align="center">
Happiness rarely burns out completely.  Instead, it merely fades away
slowly like leaves falling from Autumn into the heart-felt isolation of Winter. 
And so, to make things better, I dream of another place and time where I can escape
from the slow drain of happiness and you.   I dream of having anything to say at
just the right moment, and yet I drag on empty and lonely without the glow in
your eyes and soul.  Though, of course, I realize that you physically remain as
you again turn away.  Our happiness fades to ashes pure and grey.  No ambiguous
lies in ashes.  Nothing remains except to watch it all blow away.  Which is my
lot as you have already turned away.
</p><p align="center">
Cloves become then my only friends.  And like all true friends do in the
end, these faggots take all the life out of my heart and lungs.  All the while
offering me sweet empty comforts.  And so I prefer this sickness and disease to
make myself feel better.
</p><p align="center">
Occasionally, I must drift beyond our thin hollow walls and seek out the
masks, plastic smiles and soiled souls of our friends, and strangers.  I prefer
the strangers as they tend to be much more mysterious, though less cunning in their
lies.  And then there's always the opportunity that they might bubble with
interesting personality and perhaps something even more rare and beautiful to
offer such as the ever elusive "truth".   Truth is, of course, just another
uncontainable human fantasy like Time and Happiness.  So, I flirt with strangers
to make myself feel better.
</p><p align="center">
And, hopefully, one of our good friends will bring out the coke, or a
bottle of something unfamiliar and interesting, or at least some grass.  I
prefer to be consumed by such distractions only within the close company of friends, or
someone I can trust.  The absence of both have never kept me from seeking escape
as happiness continues to dissolve along with grains of acid, alcohol, and brain
cells.  For a time wrought by delirium, I believe I need distractions to make
myself feel better.
</p><p align="center">
Now I can hold you again as a stranger's arms coil around me.  Past the
stench of fermented rye and whiskey, somewhere embedded in my brain I can smell
your
hair drying in the morning sunlight.  In tears, I remember the soft warmth of
your skin down the back of your neck, around your waist and into the pungent
patch of wiry tendrils where my fingers would graze sleeplessly deeper into
this taste of you.  My mind wanders until her hands weave and waves across my
gaze and I then awaken to see her lips kissing my fingers which she brings up to
my lips, never realizing how recently my digits have been within you.   My
thoughts reflect upon you again as you shift, and turn away in our bed.  I can
no more reach out to touch this one now than I could to prevent your heart from
plummeting, nor my soul from drowning in dreams of the skull.   So, I let her
curls spill over my face as she reassures me now that this will make things feel
better.
</p><p align="center">
Casually, I wonder about all of these images in decadence.  Secretly,
I've always known my wings were clipped by the deceit of Happiness.  Floating
weightlessly now, ever wishing to sink deeper beneath undulating waves of your
love, her love, their love, friendship, and honesty -- anything to make things
feel better, or lose consciousness one last time.

3 a.m., party's over.  Firmly shut the door. Slide the dead-bolt deep inside a
snug, dark hole.  Tucking away my palm-pilot... it's time for a little point and
click.   Retro-Jesus Dance tracks crooning on the radio bring back classic
teenage memories, tender and fuzzy.   Still, Robert Smith doesn't impress me
now.  No more dancing incense for you, Robert.  And the Cure won't depress me
anymore.  Those were days when I still had a heart.  Days when I needed someone
to save me from myself.  Days before I began to let you wear me down.  Yeah,
You!  and You!  ...and You, too.<p align="center">
Funny how the Sex Pistols, Black Flag, and the Dead Kennedys all seem like
dusty old friends crackling back at me over the radio...  Friends on the
radio.   And so, now here I am again going down on you again, all alone with
your love between my fingers, and your image plastered into my mind's eyes. 
Auto-erotic sensationalism ever pales to your tender, controlled touch.  To
think that hands so soft could smack so-so... I can't wait!  I'll have my
satisfaction now, thank you...  and reaching to the floor, I find that worn blue
towel as Devo whips my soul to sleep.
