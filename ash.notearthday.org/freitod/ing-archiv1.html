<h5><i><b>Some thoughts concerning suicide methods:</b></i></h5>
<p>The greatest and most ignored problem of discussing suicide methods is this:<br>
Everyone concentrates on the mechanical aspects such as which pills to take,
where one can jump, where to aim, but hardly anyone makes it clear that the most
important thing is to have a practical way of overcoming the instinct to live
and the fear which is present. Most people, if they honestly consider the matter
that there is, in the first place, *no* such method, simply ignore the problem.
For example: When using a shotgun the critical point is that the moment one
pulls the trigger is very difficult and requires unbelievable will power.</p>

</a>
<h5><i><b>General discussion of methods</b></i></h5>
<p>This is important: the implements should be already on hand so that one may
carry out the method if one wants to. Everyone** knows this terrible, beautiful
moment when one says to oneself: &quot;Now I would gladly kill myself&quot;. If
you have the gun in the cabinet, the poison in the nightstand etc., it is much
easier to do then if you plan way ahead of time to die on a particular day.<br>
I think everyone <font color="#00FFFF">[who is contemplating suicide]</font>
should settle on a particular method that he is reasonably sure he can follow
through on. For instance, I am afraid of water, and therefore do not plan to
drown. Another person likes to half-strangle himself while masturbating, and
would find it easier to hang than shoot himself...</p>
<p>Note: **<font color="#00FFFF">[everyone who is suicidal, that is.]</font></p>

<h5><i><b>General discussion of methods- Poisoning</b></i></h5>
<p>There are certain plants and mushrooms that, properly applied, can lead to
death. The problem is finding a supply and knowing how to properly prepare it
and how much to use. One should know what one is doing, as neither lying on the
floor in convulsions nor having one's stomach pumped at the hospital's emergency
room is particularly pleasant.</p>

</a>
<h5><i><b>General discussion of methods- Poisoning</b></i></h5>
<p>Mushroom/Plant poisoning (&quot;homeopathic suicide&quot;):<br>
Much knowledge and experience <font color="#00FFFF">[with plants]</font> is
required to accomplish an expert poisoning. One needs to join a mushroom club or
read extensively in the subject matter. However, in doing so there is the
serious danger of finding one's life's work. :) Incidentally, I'm acquainted
with a person who is very knowledgeable about mushrooms. He can easily bake you
a mushroom souffli that would kill you (or so it is said). However, if you ask
him-innocently, of course- about specific poisonous mushrooms, his response is
almost always a qualified one, such as: X can be deadly, but only if one uses
large quantities, prepares it properly, etc. I recommend you forget about this. <font
color="#00FFFF">[The original text is unclear as to what the author is
recommending one forgets about...whether he is saying one can forget about
pumping an expert for info or whether one ought to forget about mushrooms
altogether is open to interpretation, though in the context of what is here i
would favor the former over the latter. Given what i know of this form of
poisoning, the method acts by damaging the liver...this is neither slow nor
painless.]</font></p>

<h5><i><b>General discussion of methods- Poisoning</b></i></h5>
<p>Substances truly suitable for overdosing oneself are at least as difficult to
get a hold of as a shotgun. Failed attempts can be brutal, and with a little
(not a lot) of bad luck you will be stuck with permanent damage that has
resulted from the attempt. This is not the case with a shotgun; if you follow
the rules, you will die.<font color="#00FFFF">**</font> Whether you end up more
or less decapitated and ugly to behold is beside the point. If you wish to use
&quot;sleeping pills&quot;, you'll need to go abroad to get them <font
color="#00FFFF">[keep in mind the intended readers of the original text are
probably concentrated in Germany]</font>. The more underdeveloped the country
the better, as the laws will be more lax and bribery will be easier. It is also
possible to forge prescriptions.<font color="#00FFFF">***</font></p>
<p><font color="#00FFFF">Notes:<br>
**[Of course, if you <u>don't</u> follow the principles you'll wind up
disfigured and still alive. Given the reported cases of botched attempts,
firearms are not as sure-fire a method as some make them out to be.]<br>
***[Forging prescriptions is not without its hazards. Pharmacists are known to
phone the prescribing doctor to verify a prescription...]</font></p>

<h5><i><b>General discussion of methods- Poisoning</b></i></h5>
<p>I would like to issue a very urgent warning concerning the use of sleeping
pills: the readily obtained varieties are not suitable for assuring a certain
death, and are most unsuitable when not used in conjunction with the plastic bag
method. It only makes sense to use this method when one can obtain a good
sedative such as a barbituate, and accomplishing that in Germany is unlikely.</p>

<h5><i><b>Poisoning methods: Hemlock</b></i></h5>
<p>Has anyone ever really considered a cup of hemlock to be a common, humane,
and nonviolent method? It's a sad fact for me that I've yet to even see a
hemlock plant despite having searched long for it. The plant is supposedly
&quot;widely distributed in wastelands, hedgerows, fencerows, and byways&quot;,
but is seldom seen in Germany. For example, it is on the list of endangered
plants in Baden-Wuerttemburg. By the way, does anyone know of a region where the
plant is thriving? Perhaps there is a street somewhere where the entire byway is
overgrown with it and one can simply help one's self to it.</p>
<p>It is also difficult to correctly identify the plant as there are about two
dozen or so similar, nonpoisonous plants that grow in large numbers.</p>
<p>Based on what I've read, the preparation is as follows:
<ul>
  <li>one needs about 200 grams of the fresh, whole plant (including roots)</li>
  <li>the plants are hung in a warm, dark place to dry</li>
  <li>when they are thoroughly dry, the plants are pulverized and can be stored
    this way for up to one year</li>
  <li>mix the powder in a large glass of wine, and it is ready to drink.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the book of Thucydides (not sure if spelling is correct) there is an
interview with the jailor who supposedly prepared the drink for Socrates. In it,
he says that he pulverizes as much of the dried plant as seems sufficient for
the particular person in question who is condemned to die. When the condemned
has drunk it, he should pace about the cell to make the poison work faster. When
the legs feel heavy and numb, he should lay down and wait. The entire body will
become numb, and when the numbness reaches the heart he shall die. If, however,
death does not come, one only fidgets <font color="#00FFFF">[convulses??]</font>
a bit, and one needs to try again using a higher dose. Should one survive an
attempt, no lasting damage has been done and most will fully recover within 24
hours.</p>

<h5><i><b>Poisoning methods: Hemlock</b></i></h5>
<p>It is a general rule that dried and powdered herbs can be stored for up to a
year and still retain their potency. They need to be stored in a dark place.<br>
Whether one finds the preparation tasty or not depends on one's opinion; one way
to identify the plant is that is smells like mouse urine. :-&gt;</p>

<h5><i><b>Poisoning methods: Monk's Hood</b></i></h5>
<p>The second plant that is found in Germany (poisonous mushrooms are being
excluded from consideration because of the very painful death they cause), the
blue Monk's hood, doesn't have as much appeal <font color="#00FFFF">[as hemlock]</font>.
An old report concerning an execution with this plant says:</p>
<p>(two hours after the poison was ingested)<br>
&quot;...the eyes became hideous, the mouth and throat contorted, the condemned
fell backwards off the block he had been sitting on and onto the earth as the
executioner had not restrained him. Because of this the condemned's face was
sprinkled with wine vinegar and his hair was plucked. He then returned to his
senses and dirtied himself <font color="#00FFFF">[in other words at this point
he regained consciousness and lost control of his bowels]</font>. So he was lain
upon straw and he shuddered as if he was being beaten. Then he vomited, spewing
out foul-smelling filth and liquid that was yellow and grey colored. After that
he said that he felt better. Not long after that, however, he turned onto his
side as though to sleep, but he was not allowed to sleep; he died quietly
without further movement or incident. His face had turned grey.&quot;</p>

<h5><i><b>Poisoning methods: Yew</b></i></h5>
<p>A tea made of only ten yew needles should be enough to kill. And unlike
hemlock and monkshood, yew is available at any gardenstore (i.e. nursery).</p>
<p><font color="#00FFFF">[Take this with a grain of salt :) ]</font></p>

</a>
<h5><i><b>Poisoning methods: Yew</b></i></h5>
<p>Yew: in <font color="#00FFFF">[a file that can no longer be accessed at the
URL given] </font>it is asserted that a dose of 75 needles is deadly for humans.
The trustworthiness of this is doubtful, though, as the document also
uncritically repeats the 5-minute horse legend. Yew is probably the only poison
of which the lethal dose and all the other details are readily found (such
things as lye are not being considered here). And in the nursery the plant will
be plainly labeled &quot;Taxus baccata&quot; with a tag.</p>
<p>A few notes:</p>
<p>Yew<br>
(Taxus baccata)</p>
<p>The needles contain the exceedingly poisonous alkaloid Taxin in high
concentrations. The red flesh of the berry is not poisonous <font
color="#00FFFF">[that's not what i've heard]</font>. The time is takes to die
varies a great deal (5 min. to several days) and depends on the dosage. The
poison appears to have two mechanisms of action:</p>
<p>High dosages quickly lead to failure of the heart-circulatory system with
death occurring within minutes. Supposedly, horses have been observed to die
within 5 minutes of eating the needles and twigs. Lower doses cause liver and
kidney damage, death occurring after coma after at least 24 hours.</p>
<p>Perhaps an intermediate dose would cause the following: 1-2 hours after
taking the poison one would vomit, experience body pains, dizziness, dilation of
the pupils, unconsciousness, shallow breathing, quickly followed by a slow,
irregular pulse, circulatory failure and death from breath cessation. In an
earlier era, yew was supposedly a well known poison for suicide in Middle and
Northern Europe, and was the method of choice for life-weary Druids (who didn't
leave any written records, unfortunately).</p>
<p>Does anyone know the exact dosage? One may need to experiment, perhaps on
white mice or a guinea pig or one's arch-enemy ;) <font color="#00FFFF">[The
smiley should make things clear, but for the obtuse I'll make it even clearer:
homicide is very rude and is not condoned here]</font>.</p>
<p>One could take the needles off a twig and extract the alkaloids by using a
water/ethanol solution, or by soaking them in some liquor. Without knowing more,
though, I wouldn't try this, or at best I would drink it immediately before
jumping...</p>

<h5><i><b>Poisoning methods: Yew</b></i></h5>
<p>&quot;As a rule (with horses being an exception) about an hour after
consuming the plant there is vomiting, diarrhea, slowed heartbeat and breathing,
and in severe cases respiratory paralysis.&quot;<sup>1</sup> The time for onset
of the effects is a vague approximation, as the effect depends on many unknown
variables.</p>

remain unfulfilled. even a horse would have to consume a few hundred grams of
needles before going belly-up, which imo contradicts the story in some books of
a horse dying shortly after eating a few leaves. hmmm, pardon me if i confuse

&gt;One may need to experiment, perhaps on white mice or a guinea pig.
</pre>
<p>That has already been extensively done with practically everything (including
water), though the results in most cases are not easily applied to humans (one
should note the frequently large deviation in the relative doses between related
species). Besides, experimenting on animals is repugnant.</p>

<p>I hold similar views, and I've not done anything like it myself. The problem
is, that under normal circumstances it isn't possible to obtain the pure
substance; if it was then additional animal testing would be a meaningless
cruelty. With all home-made poisons, whether it be the yew extract, the hemlock
cup, or good, old-fashioned exhaust fumes, we really don't know the potency of
the preparation, and if one is honest with oneself, it isn't possible under
normal circumstances to determine the potency by technical means. Animal trials <font

are easy to see. Naturally, it is a nasty thing to do.</p>

<h5><i><b>Poisoning methods: bitter almonds</b></i></h5>
<P>For awhile now I've been studying the poisonous plants, but am stuck on
the bitter almonds.  What I already know (from various chemistry
texts):</P>
<P>
-The seeds contain the glycoside amygdaline, which is split by the
enzyme emulsin and dilute acids into glucose, benzaldehyde, and prussic
acid.</P>
<P>
-Bitter almond oil (a colorless oil that turns yellow with age and
contains up to 11% prussic acid) can be extracted from crushed bitter
almonds or the pits of apricots, cherries, or plums by soaking.</P>
<P>
-The lethal dose for humans is about 60-70 mg prussic acid or 0.7-2.3mg
prussic acid per kg body weight or about 60 pieces  <FONT
  color="#00FFFF">[pieces are whole almonds in this context]</FONT>
   (these should be considered minimum doses).</P>
<P>
-Death results from a disruption of cellular respiration.  If a
poisoning doesn't result in death, the prussic acid will be cleared out
of the body rather quickly (possibly preventing serious, long term
damage).</P>
<P>
-100g bitter almonds contains an average of 250 mg of bound prussic
acid (at the moment I'm not sure if it's prussic acid or amygdalin);
lima beans have up to 320mg.</P>
<P>
In regards to efficacy, prussic acid is easily one of the best means
[to suicide] (see also the first entry (HCN) in the a.s.h.-FAQ).
Bitter almonds are not easy to find (due to their toxicity); I bought
a small bag of them today (50g, around 60 pieces) in a healthfood
store, and was explicitly asked whether I really wanted them.  Apricot
pits would work as well.  My problem lies in the extraction process
(I tried the bitter almond oil method) and determining proper doseage.
Does anybody here have any ideas or has anyone found anything about
this on the net?</P>

<h5><i><b>Poisoning methods: bitter almonds</b></i></h5>
<P>The problem seems to be that the prussic acid is released from the
glycosides very slowly and unreliably.  Perhaps the concentration of
the various enzymes in the stomach, which vary from individual to
individual, plays a role and is the factor which determines life or
death.  It's probable that 99% of the population could eat a big bag of
bitter almonds without ill effects (otherwise it would not be possible
to buy them), and that only in exceptional circumstances would the
majority of the chemically bound prussic acid be released.</P>
<P>
"...Apricot pits would work as well..."
Yes.  Quite some time ago an industrious ASHer had posted the
concentrations <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF"> [of prussic acid in various sources]

<h5><i><b>Poisoning methods: bitter almonds</b></i></h5>
<P><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">[What follows is a critique of the previous section]
</FONT></P>
<P>
The enzyme concentration in a person's stomach is irrelevant if the
majority of the prussic acid is chemically released before
consumption.</P>
<P>
A book of food chemistry places the lethal dose of bitter almonds at
upwards 500g, which agrees well with data in most other books which
sets the dose at around 60 almonds.  So the statement that it's
"probable that 99% of the population could eat a big bag..." is a bad
one.</P>
<P>
"...otherwise it would not be possible to buy them."--Availability
means very little. Nutmeg is quite dangerous, but you can get it
nearly anywhere.</P>
<P>
The prussic acid is chemically released by the enzyme emulsin.  This
is found in the cells of the almond and can be used to break down the
amygdalin by mixing the two together.  This is done by pulverizing the
almonds, adding a bit of water, and waiting a few hours.  If the
almonds are ground up finely enough, then most of the prussic acid
shall be released.</P>

<h5><i><b>Poisoning Methods: Cyanide</b></i></h5>
<p>(Extraction from potassium ferrocyanide) I've touched on this previously and
since then have been researching the chemistry. According to Roempp's chemistry
dictionary, heating the salt yields KCN, [an iron compound], and other stuff.
Another entry says that KCN can be transformed into HCN (this happens in the
stomach which is why KCN can work albeit more slowly) by dripping equal volumes
of water and sulfuric acid onto it. This forms gaseous HCN (breath deeeeeeeply
:-). How one would combine the two procedures is unclear to me. <font
color="#00FFFF">[One possibility is to bake the salts at a suitable temperature
and then to drip the reagents onto the salts without trying to purify them for
KCN first. I couldn't say for certain that the results would be satisfactory,
but if cyanide is the method of choice for someone then he might find it
worthwhile to experiment with this.]</font></p>
<p>The most elegant way to obtain KCN is simply to order it. Woody has briefly
written about this in a.s.h. I have similarly touched on the search for
companies that sell chemicals to private individuals. I would rather leave off
the names and addresses here as I don't know that anyone on the mailinglist is
interested in all that; there's sure to be some people in Germany who can ferret
out the appropriate specialty catalogs. In all cases the companies offer all the
potentially useful chemicals in small quantities for the hobby chemist or
biologist. Moreover they offer pure KCN (25g/15DM). However, such substances are
sold in accordance to law only to adults who send a copy of their personal ID
and who supply a so-called explanation. In the latter document a person must
specify why one needs the stuff (possibly requiring a detailed outline including
quantities and literature references). If the explanation is plausible and
carries no hint of possible misuse, then one gets the goods. My problem is
figuring out what a hobbyist would need KCN for and how to present this
explanation in the most professional way. It sounds plausible to use it in a
galvanic bath for silver-plating objects. However, I'm lacking exact details as
to the construction and concentration of reagents for such a bath. One could
also find use for it in photochemistry...If possible, I'll likely order some in
a few weeks. If it doesn't work, we could create a small pro forma company and
have it shipped legally to us in quantity :-). BTW- I've ordered myself some
chloroform. Does anyone know if this could substitute for barbiturates in the
plastic bag-over-head method? A rag moistened with it and placed next to the
head in the bag should render one unconscious, right? Better dying through
chemistry...</p>

<h5><i><b>Poisoning Methods: Cyanide</b></i></h5>
<p>There is a legitimate use for cyanide for the hobbyist: gold mining. A highly
dilute solution of KCN extracts the fine particles of gold from sand, earth,
etc. The solution that oozes out of the slurry contains all the extracted gold.
One can also use this method to test whether a several kg sample has any gold in
it. Extensive information on this can be found at the website <a
href="http://www.chemex.ca/">http://www.chemex.ca</a> (which has everything for
the semi-professional gold miner). At <font color="#00FFFF">[link no longer
exists]</font>&nbsp; there is a test kit for the cyanide analysis of 2.5 kg soil
samples which is sold for a few dollars. But keep in mind that the cyanide in
the kit could well be of a very small amount and/or highly dilute and possibly
denatured. Also, it isn't clear whether they will sell to you by mail or whether
you have to go to the store. <font color="#00FFFF">[Note that chemex no longer
offers test kits - they require people to send them the soil samples.]</font></p>

<p>In my search for sources of chemicals (KCN), I've come across a few
possibilities:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Germany: The problem with buying in Germany is that one is asked to
    present a trade license. It seems to me that the best possibility is to
    order via the internet (e.g., <a href="http://www.fisher.de/">www.fisher.de</a>)
    and to give the appearance of making a legal purchase (i.e., devise a
    plausible company name, sound professional, and order quantities of various,
    compatible stuff). My scouting expeditions through the web suggest that not
    many sellers require proof of ID. At the moment I can't try this, though, as
    I still live at home (and am broke).</li>
  <li>Countries other than Germany: German trade licenses don't mean much in
    other countries. For example, at <a href="http://www.txdirect.net/~scially">www.txdirect.net/~scially</a>
    one can purchase chemicals without providing special information.
    Unfortunately, at present they only accept American orders, &quot;but this

<h5><i><b>Poisoning Methods: Cyanide</b></i></h5>
<p>A few years ago, the newspaper &quot;Wiener&quot; conducted a test to see the
extent to which it is possible to buy poisons. The intent of this action was to
merely upbraid the German chemical industry, so they (supposedly) made it
difficult for themselves by posing as an intermediary for a &quot;foreign
customer&quot;. Moreover, they ordered a list of chemicals that would, when used
together, only be used to produce poisonous gas, and they ordered by the ton.</p>
<p>Excerpts from the newspaper article:</p>
<p>&quot;...Potassium cyanide (KCN) NS sodium cyanide (NaCN)...all such
chemicals are in the export list (Section 1, chapters C &amp; D) of C-type
chemicals that can be used for warfare...Sales to unknown domestic buyers is
also forbidden. Violators can be imprisoned for up to 10 years...</p>
<p>&quot; Suspicious or unknown buyers of these chemicals must be reported
through an early warning system. By this means the Federal customs house,
intelligence service, and investigative board are alerted.</p>
<p>The &quot;Weiner&quot; employed its shadow company, &quot;Management
Consulting&quot;. &quot;On behalf of an anonymous, foreign buyer&quot; they
tried to purchase KCN and NaCN by the ton from German companies.</p>
&quot;...On the fifth floor of 133 Storkower Street in the offices of PCK
Trading GmbH... &quot; <font color="#00FFFF">[Dialog as reported by the

    <td width="85%">We could deliver 20 tons of NaCN pretty quickly. But that is

  </tr>
  </table>
  <p>&quot;Later PCK confirmed the deal via Telex: Our offer to you is good
  until Feb.15, 1991: 20 tons of NaCN, 96-98% pure, in 30x31x44mm packets packed

  (annual sales: 10 million Marks)&quot;</p>
  <p><font color="#00FFFF">[Dialog as reported by the &quot;Weiner&quot;:]</font></p>

    <font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva">

      <td>Weiner</td>

      <td>We'll pick up the merchandise here. You'll get an end-user declaration
        for the government, understand?</td>
    </tr>
    </table>
    <p>&quot;We agreed to take 12 pallets of NaCN and KCN, which amounts to 21.6
    tons...total price of 115,600 DM plus tax. UCG wants the money up front: 'We
    don't know you.'&quot;</p>
    <p>After about 2 or 3 dozen inquiries, the smart lads of &quot;Management
    Consulting&quot; had only succeeded twice, apparently with companies that
    accept anyone as a customer. I infer from all this that a purchase is
    possible, but quite difficult and dangerous.</p>
    <p>Foreign countries: It seems to me that the import of KCN isn't as
    strongly controlled as export, and in every instance there is no outright
    prohibition. There are many possible vendors <font color="#00FFFF">[examples
    deleted as one should prolly dig stuff up like this on one's own]</font> and
    most are small firms (they don't have their own domain or website), so the
    minimum order is sure to be less than that <font color="#00FFFF">[of larger
    firms that sell by the ton]</font>.</p>
    <p>There are also catalogs for all sorts fo laboratory supplies, e.g., <a

    etc.</p>
    <p>The Aldrich catalog can bring tears to your eyes: it has everything and
    the website's design is perfect. Every little detail is thought of; for
    example one can indicate whether one wants them to ship an &quot;export of
    dangerous cargo&quot; by the cheapest land route or the faster, more
    expensive air route. Naturally, they only deliver to companies, and
    &quot;For certain items we may ask the buyer to provide written assurance

#                according to weight. Ingestion of 150mg/kg of caffeine

  <p>One needs about 50fold greater dose to evoke the first signs of poisoning.
  That would be about 250g of pure guarana powder and the chances of death
  occuring would be about 50/50. It's probable, though, that after one has
  consumed about half that amount, one will get up and hop about until utterly
  exhausted.</p>

  <h5><i><b>Poisoning methods: Ephedrine</b></i></h5>
  <p>Another possibility along these lines that occurs to me is ephedrine. It's
  action is similar to that of adrenalin (excites the sympathetic nervous
  system, raises the blood pressure) and it is found in large quantities (along
  with pseudo-ephedrine) in plants of the ephedracae (Ma Huang) family. One can
  buy a powdered form of it labeled &quot;Herba Ephedra&quot; rather easily at
  the pharmacy (250g packet for 9DM). I say relatively easily because some
  pharmacists, citing the dangerousness of these alkaloids (and several alleged
  deaths), are reluctant to sell it (at least to me ;), and pretend they are not
  allowed to. By law, however, a prescription is not required to buy this.</p>
  <p>Herba Ephedra is usually consumed as a tea (3-9g per dose) and it heightens
  one's energy (especially in combination with guarana, the effect being not
  unlike that of &quot;speed&quot;). Thus ephedrine is useful for doping. One of
  the most important uses for ephedra is that of treating colds. The lethal dose
  as well as the percentage of ephedrine in the herb ephedra is unknown to me at
  this time (though I'm sure I'll find them on the net). Naturally, such a death
  is not pleasant. If nothing else, though, the urge to move about could be
  harnessed for a jump off a roof :)</p>

Ephedra
Contents: ephedrine, saponin, vitamin C
portion used: branches
medical use: regulate breathing, relieve spasms

<FONT color="#00FFFF">[a more]</FONT> exact list of contents:
l-ephedrine
d-pseudoephedrine
l-methylephedrine
d-methylpseudoephedrine
l-norephedrine
d-norpseudoephedrine
ephedrine/saponin/tannin (hence the bitter taste) and a glycoside.

Alkaloid content between 0.65-1.7%, many varieties having up to 6%.
</pre>
  <font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva">
<P>Effect: similar to speed or XTC.  It's a euphoric.  It enhances physical
stamina.  In contrast to guarana, the mental stamina, among other
things, is reduced, and it makes concentration more difficult.  It makes
the breathing easier and is a mild aphrodesiac.  The active ingredient
in ephedra, ephedrine, acts on the sympathetic nervous system like
adrenalin.  It is also a diuretic.

<P>Preparation as a tea:  Pour the boiling water onto the herb (about 3
teaspoons per cup) and allow to infuse at least 10 minutes.  Lemon juice
enhances the solubility of the alkaloids.</P>

<P>To prepare as a concentrate:  Another possible way to extract the active
substance from the herb is to put it in lemon juice.  The mixture of
pure lemon juice and ephedra should stand at least 12 hours, preferably
longer, and then can be poured through a sieve to make the concentrate
ready for use.</P>

<P>Availability: Herba ephedra can be bought at any pharmacy in Germany.
A prescription is NOT required, though it is often out of stock and has
to be ordered.  I paid 9DM for a 250g packet.  In various pharmacies
they didn't want to sell to me because ephedrine requires a prescription
though the plant it is derived from does not have this requirement.</P>

<P>How this is relevant to the mailing list: There is sure to be a lethal
dose that is dependent on the amount of alkaloid <FONT color="#00FFFF">[in the dose].  
</FONT>The
more the better.  I find the effects of a normal dose pleasant, but
people have to try things out for themselves.  I think it would combine
well with guarana as follows:250g ephedra brewed in a tea with lemon
juice and any water needed, this being used to dissolve as much guarana
powder as possible.  Then one could swallow additional dry guarana
powder, washing it down with the tea.  One would likely die from a
"heart-attack" or someting similar.  This would be very unpleasant.  One
could use the induced restlessness to jump.  An advantage of this method
is the wide availability of the needed ingredients.</P>

<P><FONT color="#00FFFF">[Of potential interest: 3 cases of ephedrine toxicity were

  <h5><i><b>Poisoning methods: GHB</b></i></h5>
  <P>My most promising, most recent discovery in the methods-paradise is GHB
(gamma-hydroxybutyrate).  It is a narcotic, and it is used in
anasthesiology.  Unfortunately it doesn't repress any of the bodily
responses to dying (e.g., the changes that occur due to changes in CO2
concentrations), and therefore has to be used with something else (e.g.,
barbituates) in order to reach the necessary level of sedation.  This
is quite a disadvantage, since the possession of <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">[enough]
</FONT> barbituates
would make this method pointless <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">[as one could use them 
alone, instead].</FONT>
The easy availability of the raw materials to make GHB as well as its
effects can make this method tenable, however.</P>
  <P>Details: When taken in small doses orally, the effects of GHB are
similar to alcohol (it relaxes, makes one sociable, is aphrodisiacal,
but without the hangover) and is supposedly an excellent antidepressive
(which might interest the reader who has tried all the others even if
this is off-topic).  It is good for insommnia (one falls asleep faster
and awakes energized).  That is the dose for recreational use.  In
higher doses (3-8g) the above effects are heightened, and beyond a
certain threshold one falls into a very deep sleep and abruptly awakens
about 3-4 hours later (after most of it has been removed from the
system via the TCA cycle).  Upon awakening one would take another dose
to get a full night's sleep.  One does not build a tolerance to it.  In
still higher doses one supposedly becomes comatose and cannot be
awakened until, as before, about 4 hours later (with no damage!).  And
this brings me to my point.  To fall into a coma with a plastic bag over
the head seems to me to be a relatively pleasant way to turn one's back
on life.  While the body would indeed react to the climing levels of
CO2, it is my hope that I would not be aware of it and would be
incapable of doing what is necessary to remove the bag (reflexive
floundering around being the exception).
</P>
  <P>Unfortunately this text is riddled with guesswork and stipulations; I
would be pleased to offer something more concrete, but unfortunately I
can't.  My personal experience is derived from a dose of about 3 heaping
teaspoons of powdered, home-made NaGHB which I dissolved in water and
drank.  I suspect the quality was very poor as I felt ill the entire
following day.  I was a "quivering, nervous wreck" as someone so
beautifully described the condition in alt.drugs.chemistry.  That should
not deter you as the fault was entirely mine.  GHB per se is non-toxic
and has a high lethal dose.  Now, as to the actual effect: it set in
after 15 minutes, my perception being obviously altered.  Within the
next quarter hour I had ringing in my ears and could hear by own heart
beat.  From the adjoining room came muddled music which struck me as
being so pleasing that I couldn't resist listening to it.  Getting up
and moving about seemed rather difficult, and even though I've never
been drunk I think the condition would be similar.  I laid down on my
sister's bed and started babbling nonsense.  All in all a very pleasant
sensation.  After I became quite comfortable everything went blank.
Suddenly I woke up and there were various members of the family standing
around me looking quite alarmed.  Somehow I managed to get rid of them,
even though I had no idea what they wanted, and immediately went back to
sleep.  3 hours later, at 2:30am, I woke up, and it slowly became clear
to me that something had gone awry.  Seven hours of terrible boredom
followed without any possibility of going back to sleep.  I then learned
that shortly after I had fallen asleep I was found and couldn't be
awakened.  My sister thought I had taken some sort of sleeping pill, and
that made the chaos complete.  After intensive and quite rough attempts
of the people present to awaken me, my mother attempted to resuscitate
me and nearly pulled my head off.</P>
  <P>Had I not awakened when I did, I would have, like so many other
unfortunate ones (of whom I have read with some amusement) awakened in
the hospital with little tubes coming out of my body.  And while some
stranger may think my experience makes a funny story, like the others I
found it embarrassing and humiliating. <FONT color="#00FFFF">[Moral of the story might
 be to
try this in a place where one is not likely to be found and pounced on.]
</FONT>
</P>
  <P>A brief summary: 3 teaspoons of NaGHB put me (and I'm 1.88m tall, weigh
83kg) into a deep sleep which according to my mother (who is a nurse)
was deeper than that caused by over the counter sleeping pills.  I
suppose it was between a medium and a high dose.  A higher dose, one of
30g, for instance (at the time I had synthesized over a kilogram, so
having a dose that size would have been no problem), which would be
about 10 teaspoons, would have put me into a temporary coma.  As with
other drugs, alcohol multiplies the effect of small doses, making it
possible to take a lethal dose more easily (this combination has already
brought about some lethal accidents, death occurring so far as I know
by respiratory paralysis; I don't know whether the people affected thus
were conscious).  The uncertainty is in whether it is possible to be
roused out of this comatose state by the high CO2 concentrations.  If it
is possible one can forget about this method, though it seems ideal.  If
one takes an interest in GHB, either for recreational purposes or out
of a death wish, it's a good idea to look around on the net.  Among
other things one will find very good instructions on how to synthesize
it.  Anyone who finds material on this method, either favorable or not,
should present it here.</P>

  <P>Sources: Three possibilities occur to me,</P>
  <P>1.NaGHB, the endproduct, is in some countries illegal or it requires a
prescription.  However, one can buy it, for example, in South Africa
(expensive!) <FONT color="#00FFFF">[In the U.S.of A. it is a controlled substance.  If you
buy it abroad, there's also the matter of getting it past customs...]</FONT>

<P>
$0.45/gm-$0.30/gm <FONT color="#00FFFF">[see the orginal text for the ad in English that
follows this]</FONT></P>
<P>
It's my guess that one could possibly also obtain it in Germany but I'm
not certain.  One could need to ask around.
</P>
  <P>2.kits: There are vendors that sell the necessary chemicals in a pre-
cursor form as kits and one need only follow the simple directions to
synthesize it at home.  The vendors are all in foreign countries <FONT color="#00FFFF">
[i.e.,
outside Germany] </FONT>and are often as much as an order of magnitude more
expensive than buying the actual raw material.</P>
  <P>3.Chemicals:  The best option is to buy the chemicals yourself; I
ordered mine through the pharmacy.  Prices: gamma-butyl-lactone
100ml/40DM; 1liter/80DM   NaOH 100g/13DM
Nobody asked me what I wanted to use them for (I bought the chemcals in
two seperate pharmacies).  In a pinch one could say that one is buying
for someone else, and that you have no idea what that person wants them
for.  Possible uses: gamma-butyl-lactone for organic synthesis (e.g., to
attach to a carboxylproply side chain)  NaOH: used in photochemstry.</P>
<P>
I acquired the NaOH the following day (buy more than 100g-see the
synthesis protocol- as it is cheaper when bought in quantity.  Nobody
had heard of lactone and they had to educate themselves.  The next day
they offered me the above said chemical.  With 1 liter lactone and the
appropriate amount of NaOH on can synthesize more than 1.3kg NaGHB for
about 150DM <FONT color="#00FFFF">[these days that's about $88 US]</FONT> 
assuming one has the
necessary equiptment (scale, pH-meter, etc.).  One uncertaintly I have
concerns the purity of the chemicals as I hadn't asked, but that really
doesn't bother me.</P>
<P>
Comments on the synthesis: IMO the simplest is the synthesis <FONT color="#00FFFF">
[protocol]</FONT>
using "95% grain alcohol" (I used 94% ethanol which one can get for
3DM/liter practically anywhere), as one simply pours all the chemicals

  <h5><i><b>Methods/poison/KCl</b></i></h5>
  <p>The first hundred times or so that I read the methods file I basically
  skimmed it. I didn't have a syringe as there didn't seem to be much point; it
  wasn't clear what the exact dose should be or whether the method would be
  painful and the only thing I knew for certain was that nobody else knew,
  either.</p>
  <p>However, in a computer magazine there's an ad for the refills for jet ink
  printers, and these come with a syringe and tubule <font color="#00FFFF">[the
  name of the company is omitted]</font>.</p>
  <p>Potassium chloride is a natural trace substance found in food and in the
  body alike, is quite harmless (unless taken intervenously, naturally), and is
  even found in fertilizers. It must be possible to obtain in its pure form. <font
  color="#00FFFF">[Of course it is. Any general chemical supply house should
  carry it.]</font></p>
  <p>The effect of injecting KCl is that it causes the heart to stop. It doesn't
  cause breathing to stop. It is potentially a good method to use if one plans
  to rent a hotel room for a day, as I imagine that if one survives the
  &quot;heart attack&quot;, one could leave and go about one's business as
  though nothing had taken place the next morning (also, the lack of trauma in
  the wake of such a failure is a tremendous advantage). KCl does not damage
  anything, rather it neutralizes the nerve impulses for awhile. Is there a
  catch? Is it so painful that one cries out and flounders about? When the heart
  stops, it must be the case that a person loses consciousness within seconds
  because the blood pressure plummets. It would be a good idea to practice with
  the syringe abit beforehand, finding a vein and drawing a bit of blood <font
  color="#00FFFF">[to verify one is actually in the vein]</font>. As long as the
  content of the syringe is not injected, one can abort the attempt without
  there being any tell- tale clues (in contrast to cutting the arteries). It's
  possible to play abit with the attempt, perhaps doing it while taking a hot
  bath for example, and sounds like a good deal, yes?</p>

  <p>The real problem is that of giving yourself an intervenous injection. This
  requires not only courage but experience. Medical textbooks explain the
  procedure, and only the first attempt would be unpleasant (you might use a

  <h5><i><b>Methods/Drowning</b></i></h5>
  <p>My own recommendations as to a &quot;good&quot; method are roughly as
  follows (first theory):</p>
  <p>Phase 1: The decision and preparation. One acquires the equiptment and the
  skills necessary and stores the equiptment for the day it is needed. Ideally
  this will all appear natural and will not exceed one's resources in terms of
  time and money.<font color="#00FFFF"> [What the author has in mind is the
  acquisition of a boat, but this could apply to finding an appropriate body of
  water and keeping a bottle or two of liquor and some weights on hand, i
  suppose.]</font></p>
  <p>Phase 2: <font color="#00FFFF">[mental]</font> preparation. Because it's
  possible to abort the attempt at virtually any point without negative
  consequences, I don't have to wrestle with the survival instinct.</p>
  <p>Phase 3: The actual deed. To facilitate execution of this, it should not be
  instantly fatal or immediately lead to pain or intense dis- comfort.</p>
  <p>Phase 4: There is a period of time when one sets out to drown when it is
  still possible to save oneself.</p>
  <p>Phase 5: At this point death is inevitable and if I panic at this point
  there is nothing I can do; I can't save myself.</p>
  <p>And now for some practical considerations as to how to bring on death
  through poison, drowning, or suffocation (really, there's nothing pleasant
  about it).</p>
  <p>Once it's decided that drowning is to be the method, to ensure its success
  I need to do it out on the open seas, far away from civiliza- tion. That
  sounds incredibly extravagent, but perhaps it's not really such overkill.</p>
  <p>Phase 1: How can a landlubber quickly and cheaply acquire a seaworthy boat
  and experience <font color="#00FFFF">[sailing it]</font>? First, the license:
  In specialty magazines such as &quot;Boat&quot; you can find ads for weekend
  crash courses. The license for navigating the open seas (as opposed to the one
  for inland navigation) can be acquired in two weekends for about 1000 DM <font
  color="#00FFFF">[roughly $450 US]</font>. The next problem is how to get a
  boat. A boat is expensive...<font color="#00FFFF">[some verbage skipped]</font>...and
  berths are both scarce and expensive. Given these considerations it seems best
  to charter a boat. A simple motorboat can be had for about <font
  color="#00FFFF">[$450 US]</font> per week, and will be ready and fueled
  whenever you want it.</p>
  <p>Phase 2: If the boat comes equipped with flotation tanks you'll need to
  destroy them. Also, throw overboard anything that could serve as a flotation
  device.</p>
  <p>Phase 3 through 5: Tie a weight to yourself and make holes in the boat's
  floor with an ice-ax <font color="#00FFFF">[you remembered to bring the ax,
  right? ;)] </font>While the boat is filling with water (and this is best done
  in the late evening hours, BTW), you can drink a bottle or two of liquor to
  take your mind off your impending demise. If the boat sinks completely,
  there'll be nothing for you to instinctively grab onto (and for me this is an
  important consideration).</p>
  <p>How can your plan be foiled?</p>

  <p>The whole point of all the trouble and expense is to get far enough from
  the coast that there aren't any police-boats nearby. A diesel is ample for the
  purpose, and we don't need anything for the return trip :-). About all spy-equiptment
  can do is verify that a boat has disappeared.</p>
  <p>A real hazard is that the boat fails to sink. Definitely not recommended
  are the very light boats with hulls made of fiberglass. Best would be a boat
  that isn't too small, made the old way with a solid steel hull and a
  substantial engine.</p>
  <p>The boat's ability to sink is really only a backup. <font color="#00FFFF">[Consider
  this scenario]</font>: I decide to weigh myself down and jump overboard, and
  before the jump I destroy the boat in a way that simulates an accident. Then I
  possibly realize (or more likely, probably realize) that I'm too cowardly to
  jump, but then in that situation I don't have to.</p>

  <p>An acquaintance who works in the coastguard once told me that many of the

  mind in that way. The last thoughts should be clear and not muddled by
  sleeping pills. Besides, I think that would take too long; once I make the
  decision to die, I don't want to spend a lot of time swimming about <font

  must go quickly, but not hurried along by drugs. Nobody should take the final
  step hastily and without thinking it over. While I think it grand to die
  quickly once my mind has been made up, I can't say for certain that I wouldn't
  change my mind at the last minute. <font color="#00FFFF">[In other words, the
  use of sleeping pills in this method makes it difficult to abort the attempt

<PRE>
   Drowning is not a recommended method.  It's an unhappy, humiliating
   experience.  I tried, but didn't drown, because the impact burst
   the chains that were holding me, the bicycle, and the weights
   together.  I didn't count on *that* happening.  I rose up and
   plopped back on the surface of the water.  Then panic, an
   interesting, atavistic mechanism, kicked in.  And then my awareness
   split in two, and I observed myself in the midst of my panic and
   thought, &quot;Oh, shit, I'm going to survive&quot;, while I paddled about on
   my back in the water and monotonous, perhaps even ecstatic, screams
   came out of me through the dark and endless night.  Aaaah!  Aaaah!
   Aaaah!  I'm not trying to be cynical; this is how I see the matter.
-</PRE>
<P>The best solution I can think of for securing the weights would be
this:  take disks of cast-iron (from a dumbell).  The disks have a hole
in the middle.  The 5kg disks are too bulky, so use six of the 2.5kg
disks.  15kg is about enough weight to nullify any buoyancy.  Take a
towing rope.  It has a loop on either end and can withstand a yank of
up to one ton of force <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">[without breaking]. </FONT> Pass 
the rope through the
holes in the disks so that when you wear the rope like a belt, the
loops overlap in front of your stomach when you suck it in a little
(if the rope is too loose one can hurt oneself in the jump.  The
weights should not flap around.  :-)  Take a padlock <FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">[and
 lock the two loops together]. </FONT> Now one is ready to go.  One can wear
  this under a
jacket, or, even better, in the jacket's lining.  Those who wish to
sink themselves in the North Sea could, in the worse case, use a
backpack filled with rocks linked to the bike frame.  Also, the belt
of weights also makes it difficult to climb (I think it rather fussy
and time consuming to climb over a parapet with a bicycle, especially
when one is chained to it).</P>

<P>About panic:  I've read and heard a number of anecdotes from people
who were saved at the last moment, and most say that at that moment
they were still conscious but no longer were experiencing panic.
Perhaps when the oxygen deprivation reaches a certain point it has the
effect of a drug, and the animalistic part of a person ceases to exist
before the consciousness<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF"> [ceases to exist].</FONT></P>

  <h5><i><b>Methods/drowning</b></i></h5>
  <P>Practical advice from RTL** in yesterday evening's "extra" edition:</P>
<P>
Two autos (one with a sunroof, the other without) were towed to the
Attersee in Austria.  Two planks were placed half in the water<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF">
 [and half on the beach] </FONT>so that the cars would not be held back in their
descent by any uneveness of the ground.  The autos were hooked to a
security cable and they held passengers (supplied with tanks of air)
and were shoved into the water (the engines had been replaced with
lead weights to avoid polluting the water).  The results were as
follows:</P>
<P>
With windows closed<FONT COLOR="#00FFFF"> [this must be the one without 
a sunroof]</FONT>:</P>
<P>
When the auto lost contact with the ground it floated a few seconds
during which time the motor compartment sank first.  One could see the
way the water level climbed over the windshield that there was still
air in the passenger compartment.  The water pressure outside the auto
prevented the doors from being opened, and the water had disabled the
electric window opener.</P>
<P>
The time from when the driver's head went underwater and the point it
became possible to open the door because the water had filled the car
and the pressure had been thus equalized was 50 seconds.  In this
amount of time the occupants became disoriented and would not be
expected to save themselves.</P>
<P>
With the windows and sunroof open:</P>
<P>
The car sank much more quickly.  Water rushed in through the front
window and the car tipped until it was perpendicular to the water.
After that, the sunroof went under the water and the car sank very
quickly; in less than two seconds the back end was submerged.  Before
that happened, though, the passengers saved themselves by leaving
through the rear doors, windows, and the sunroof.</P>
<P>
In the attempt to pull the cars back up the security cable broke, so
the car is still at the bottom of the Attersee beneath 100m of water.
In Germany, an accident (?) similar to the conditions of this
experiment supposedly happens every three days.</P>

  <P>A warning to anyone who is thinking of drowning in a river: a newspaper
reports that "An eleven year old in Glauchau near Chemnitz survived a
68m jump from an iron bridge into the river Mulde."  Naturally, there
was no mention that this was an attempted suicide!  Also, there was
no mention as to why he survived.

  <h5><i><b>Methods/Jumping</b></i></h5>
  <P>Hardly anything has been said about jumping.  According to the ASH FAQ,
a height of 10 stories would have a high probability of success. High
buildings are found [most] everywhere, and the only barrier (albeit
a large one) is that of overcoming one's fears and making the leap.
There isn't the uncertain waiting around the way there is with poison.
I think it would be pretty bad to poison myself and then survive.  To
overcome the inhibition to jump one could take some alcohol or some
other drug (or taking the drug could make one feel so bad as to
prompt one to jump so as to put an end to the misery).

  <h5><i><b>Methods/Jumping</b></i></h5>
  <p>Jumping is considered one of the more attractive methods. It has the
  advantage of requiring little preparation. Neither acquisition of contraband
  nor special knowledge is required; one simply has to find a high place to jump
  from. There are, however, three drawbacks:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>like any method, one needs to overcome one's inhibition;</li>
    <li>not being a particularly private method, it is likely (depending on
      location) that a number of people will necessarily see the mess you make;</li>
    <li>should you actually survive, the situation will likely be an unpleasant
      one <font color="#00FFFF">[think &quot;Ethan Frome&quot; here]</font>.
  </ul>
  <p>There was a report in the news awhile ago about a cool example of this
  method: someone went along for a balloon ride and at a high altitude climbed
  out.</p>
  <p>Jumping would be good combined with other methods as a back-up <font
  color="#00FFFF">[i.e., if the latter method doesn't work, jumping is a sort of
  fail-safe to assure success ;-) ]</font>.</p>

  <h5><i><b>Methods/jumping</b></i></h5>
  <p>Unless I was in an extremely emotionally stressful situation, I know I
  wouldn't be able to jump as I have a slight fear of heights. To stand on the
  brink without a railing and look around is already too much for me; such a
  situation with a railing added is itself very oncomfortable. Perhaps we should
  collect ideas on how to make the method easier. A few come to mind:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Alcohol: This is perhaps one of the best facilitators of jumping,
      freezing, and drowning.</li>
    <li>Alkaloid drugs (e.g., thornapple, belladonna etc.): According to various
      books on Ethnobotany these drugs (either mixed or taken seperately)
      ingested or applied to the mucus membranes induce strong hallucinations.
      One is no longer in control of one's senses and sees and does the craziest
      things. People, after drinking a tea made of thornapple leaves, have been
      known to be chased by monsters through the woods and in the process get
      cut up and break parts of their bodies without even being aware of the
      damage until they come to their senses days later in a hospital. What is
      more, the alkaloids are themselves often fatal in rather small doses
      (which would be good should one muff the jump). There are a few
      disadavantages, though:
      <ul>
        <li>procuring the plants (thornapple, at least, is offered by various
          mail-order companies. For the addressess of these companies, look at
          the ads in magazines like &quot;Hemp&quot; and &quot;Grow&quot;).</li>
        <li>instead of jumping, you may end up hopping around in the streets
          naked, looking for someone to screw with.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>LSD: I've tried this twice before in small doses, and found it rather
      unpleasant. Thousands of thoughts buzzed around in my head. This would
      make it easier for me to jump. It would be expected, though, for
      individuals to be affected by the drugs in different ways.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>A quick and relatively painless poison like cyanide would serve to
  considerably lessen one's inhibition against jumping IMO <font color="#00FFFF">[if
  you have cyanide, why bother with the jump??].</font></p>

  <p>High buildings and viewing platforms terrify me. I KNOW I couldn't possibly

  <h5><i><b>Methods: Hanging</b></i></h5>
  <p>Rope is a possibility, but nobody really knows how long it really takes or
  whether the blood vessels and windpipe are completely blocked. This is dicey
  and totally uncool.</p>
  <p><font color="#00FFFF">[It may seem obvious that the goal of hanging is to
  choke or strangle, but the object of hanging is to break the neck. That is why
  proper execution of the method includes a dropping of the body, as the force
  of the body's weight at the bottom of a good drop is usually more than the
  neck muscles can withstand. Whether this is uncool is a matter of opinion.]</font></p>

  <hr size="1" width="62%">
  </a>
  <h5><i><b>Methods: Train</b></i></h5>
  <p>This is a possibility but only when the train is going at full speed and
  not creeping along at 80km/h <font color="#00FFFF">[this is about 50 mph]</font>.
  The rail- sweeper is only two finger breadths from the rail, so rather than
  being decapitated one is going to get his skin torn off, the result being
  rather grisly. The chances of someone thus mutilated being &quot;saved&quot;
  are pretty good.</p>
  <p><font color="#00FFFF">[It isn't necessary to get under the wheels of a
  train to die from the encounter. The shock of being hit by about a ton of
  metal traveling around 50mph proved fatal to at least three people in northern
  California in the first half of 1999 alone.]</font></p>

  <h5><i><b>Methods: Automobile</b></i></h5>
  <p>Automobile/motorcycle accident: The problem with this method is similar to
  that of jumping off a high building, but it is somewhat more certain as one
  can attain higher velocities. It would be unfortunate, though, if one lost
  one's nerve about 100 meters before impact and used the brake...</p>

  <hr size="1" width="62%">
  </a>
  <h5><i><b>Methods: Knife - possible problems</b></i></h5>
  <p>It seems to me that the most important thing about this method is that it
  be performed deliberately and not suddenly in a moment when one's mood is
  oscillating a great deal. By this I mean to say I'm less concerned with the
  pain or how long it takes then the consciousness of the consequences and
  finality of the deed and the necessity to take the act to it's conclusion <font
  color="#00FFFF">[a half-attempt will in all probability leave one scarred if
  not maimed and still alive]</font>. Therefore I think the classical choice of
  cutting the arteries is best. The necessarily deep, parallel cuts would be
  very painful, so I am afraid that my willpower may be wanting. Hence my
  question: Is it possible to diminish the pain of this method without weakening
  the consciousness <font color="#00FFFF">[and hence the resolve]</font>,
  perhaps by a local anesthetization?</p>

  <hr size="1" width="62%">
  </a>
  <h5><i><b>Methods:Knife - problem resolution</b></i></h5>
  <p>You can make the arm completely insensitive to pain by chilling it. Give it
  a try by holding the hand several hours in cold water. Don't use ice water,
  rather water straight out of the tap (perhaps tapwater is too warm in the
  summer. I wouldn't know as I tried this in winter). After about 4 hours, one
  suddenly has the sensation that the chilled hand is no longer part of one's
  body but is rather a piece of dead wood. It is completely numbed. Despite
  that, if you do not feel any pain, you might develop a reluctance to cut
  deeply, and there is the risk that the procedure won't work unless you know
  something about anatomy and know exactly what you're doing.</p>
