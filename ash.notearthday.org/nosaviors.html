<p>You have no idea how insulting this is. </p>

<p>After reading your savior-posts, I cried for the first time in months. And seeing as I
was in the lab at the time, amidst people, this was a Bad and Scary Thing. </p>

<p>Do you want to &quot;save&quot; my life? Do you even know what life is? I don't think
you do- you're much too caught up in it. Does saving my life entail ensuring that my heart
is beating, that I am respirating? Does God pay you by the heartbeat? I would certainly
hope he doesn't pay you commensurate to the joy I experience; you wouldn't be able to
purchase a cup of coffee in Heaven. </p>

<p>Aside from various poets I've encountered the people who post here are some of the few
people I've met who I believe know what life is. Why? Because we miss it. Because we want
it more than you'll ever know. </p>

<p>Life is having someone else care one whit for you above &quot;Of course I'm concerned.
I'm a Christian. I'm supposed to be.&quot; </p>

<p>Life is being touched. </p>

<p>Life is being loved. </p>

<p>I am NOT living a life. For whatever reason, my circumstances have chosen to tear me,
unkindly and in whole, from the fabric of human experience. Right now, I am a lump of
flesh carrying out sundry clinical functions. For you to suggest that I even have a
&quot;life&quot; to save, only shows that you have absolutely no empathy for my situation.
YOU are being patronizing. YOU are being degrading. </p>

<p>Is this getting through? Does this penetrate your dogma, MR. SAVIOR? </p>

<p>Fuck. I'm going to cry again. :-( </p>
