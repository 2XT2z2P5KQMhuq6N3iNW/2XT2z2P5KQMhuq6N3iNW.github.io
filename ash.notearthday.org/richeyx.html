<P align="center">For sale<br>
Dumb cunt's same dumb questions<br>
Oh virgins<br>
Listen, all virgins are liars honey</P>
<P align="center">And I don't know what I'm scared of<br>
Or what I even enjoy<br>
Dulling, get money<br>
But nothing turns out like you want it to</P>
<P align="center">And in these plagued streets<br>
Of pity you can buy anything<br>
For $200 anyone can conceive a god on video</P>
<P align="center">He's a boy<br>
You want a girl so tear off his cock<br>
Tie his hair in bunches, fuck him<br>
Call him Rita if you want</P>
<P align="center">I eat and I dress and I wash<br>
And I still can say thank you<br>
Puking, shaking, sinking<br>
I still stand for old ladies<br>
Can't shout, can't scream<br>
Hurt myself to get pain out</P>
<P align="center">I 'T' them, 24:7, all year long<br>
Purgatory's circle, drowning here<br>
Someone will always say yes</P>
<P align="center">Funny place for the social<br>
For the insects to start caring<br>
Just an ambulance at the bottom of a cliff</P>
<P align="center">In these plagued streets<br>
Of pity you can by anything<br>
For $200 anyone can conceive a god on video</P>

Tie his hair in bunches, fuck him<br>
Call him Rita if you want, if you want</P>

Puking, shaking, sinking<br>
I still stand for old ladies<br>

I hurt myself to get pain out</P>
<P align="center">Power produces desire<br>
The weak have none<br>
There's no lust in this coma<br>
Even for a fifty<br>
Solitude, solitude<br>
The 11th commandment</P>
<P align="center">The only certain thing<br>
That is left about me<br>
There's no part of my body<br>
That has not been used</P>
<P align="center">Pity or pain<br>
To show displeasure's shame<br>
Everyone I've loved or hated<br>
Always seems to leave</P>
<P align="center">And in these plagued streets<br>
Of pity you can buy anything<br>

Lie down, do as they say<br>
May as well be heaven<br>
This hell smells the same<br>
These sunless afternoons<br>
I can't find myself</P>

<P align="center" class="item-title">WALKING ABORTION</P>
<P align="center">I knew that someday I was gonna die<br>
And I knew before I died<br>
Two things would happen to me<br>
That number one I would regret my entire life<br>
And number two I would want to live my life over again</P>
<P align="center">Life is lead weights, pendulum died<br>
Pure or lost, spectator or crucified<br>
Recognised truth acedia's blackest hole<br>
Junkies winos whores the nation's moral suicide</P>
<P align="center">Loser, liar, fake or phoney<br>
No one cares<br>
Everyone is guilty<br>
Fucked up, dunno why<br>
You poor little boy</P>
<P align="center">We are all of walking abortions<br>
Shalom shalom we all love our children<br>
We all are of walking abortions<br>
Shalom shalom there are no horizons</P>
<P align="center">Mussolini hangs from a butcher's hook<br>
Hitler reprised in the worm of your soul<br>
Horthy's corpse screened to a million<br>
Tiso revived, the horror of a bullfight</P>
<P align="center">Fragments of uniforms<br>
Open black ruins<br>
A moral conscience<br>
You've no wounds to show<br>
So wash your car<br>
In your "X" baseball shoes</P>
<P align="center">We are all of walking abortions<br>
Shalom shalom we all love our children<br>
We all are of walking abortions<br>
Shalom shalom there are no horizons</P>
<P align="center">Little people in little houses<br>
Like maggots small blind and worthless<br>
The massacred innocent blood stains us all</P>
<P align="center">Who's responsible, you fucking are<br>
Who's responsible, you fucking are<br>
Who's responsible, you fucking are<br>
Who's responsible, you fucking are<br>
Who's responsible</P>
<hr class="divider-line">
<P align="center" class="item-title">4ST &LB</P>
<P align="center">I eat too much to die<br>
And not enough to stay alive<br>
I'm sitting in the middle waiting</P>
<P align="center">Days since I last pissed<br>
Cheeks sunken and despaired<br>
So gorgeous sunk to six stone<br>
Lose my only remaining home</P>
<P align="center">See my third rib appear<br>
A week later all my flesh disappears<br>
Stretching taut, cling-film on bone<br>
I'm getting better</P>
<P align="center">Karen says I've reached my target weight<br>
Kate and Emma and Kristin know it's fake<br>
Problem is diet's not a big enough word<br>
I wanna be so skinny that I rot from view</P>
<P align="center">I want to walk in the snow<br>
And not leave a footprint<br>
I want to walk in the snow<br>
And not soil its purity</P>
<P align="center">Stomach collapsed at five<br>
Lift up my skirt my sex is gone<br>
Naked and lovely and 5 stone 2<br>
May I bud and never flower</P>
<P align="center">My vision's getting blurred<br>
But I can see my ribs and I feel fine<br>
My hands are trembling stalks<br>
And I can feel my breasts are sinking</P>
<P align="center">Mother tries to choke me with roast beef<br>
And sits savouring her sole Ryvitta<br>
That's the way you're built my father said<br>
But I can change, my cocoon shedding</P>
<P align="center">I want to walk in the snow<br>
And not leave a footprint<br>
I want to walk in the snow<br>
And not soil its purity</P>
<P align="center">Kate and Kristin and Kit Kat<br>
All things I like looking at<br>
Too weak to fuss, too weak to die<br>
Choice is skeletal in everybody's life</P>
<P align="center">I choose my choice, I starve to frenzy<br>
Hunger soon passes and sickness soon tires<br>
Legs bend, stockinged I am Twiggy<br>
And I don't mind the horror that surrounds me</P>
<P align="center">Self-worth scatters, self-esteem's a bore<br>
I long since moved to a higher plateau<br>
This discipline's so rare so please applaud<br>
Just look at the fat scum who pamper me so</P>
<P align="center">Yeah 4 stone 7, an epilogue of youth<br>
Such beautiful dignity in self-abuse<br>
I've finally come to understand life<br>
Through staring blankly at my navel</P>
<hr class="divider-line">
<P align="center" class="item-title">DIE IN THE SUMMERTIME</P>
<P align="center">Scratch my leg with a rusty nail, sadly it heals<br>
Colour my hair but the dye grows out<br>
I can't seem to stay a fixed ideal</P>
<P align="center">Childhood pictures redeem, clean and so serene<br>
See myself without ruining lines<br>
Whole days throwing sticks into streams</P>
<P align="center">I have crawled so far sideways<br>
I recognise dim traces of creation<br>
I wanna die, die in the summertime, I wanna die</P>
<P align="center">The hole in my life even stains the soil<br>
My heart shrinks to barely a pulse<br>
A tiny animal curled into a quarter circle<br>
If you really care wash the feet of a beggar</P>
<P align="center">I have crawled so far sideways<br>
I recognise dim traces of creation<br>
I wanna die, die in the summertime, I wanna die</P>
<P align="center">I have crawled so far sideways<br>
I recognise dim traces of creation<br>
I wanna die, die in the summertime, I wanna die</P>
