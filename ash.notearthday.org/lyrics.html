<h3>Catch Me</h3>

<pre>

   I've been standing on the edge of the roof looking down,
   I've been looking at the people that are gathering around,
   I've been here for an hour or maybe even more,
   Just looking at the people that I've never seen before,
   Stupid little faces are all I can see,
   Those silly little suckers are all laughing at me,
   No wills cheap thrills you're all puppets to the master,
   Your only satisfaction is my lonely disaster,
   You learned how to creep and you learned how to crawl,
   But you never really learned anything at all.

   When I was a boy everything was just fine,
   I learned how to talk and how to walk in line,
   I had to learn the rules that build our society,
   But I could never undstand it didn't mean shit to me,
   Everybody always told me I was out of my mind,
   But I never did kiss anybody's behind,
   I'm a lot older and I guess I should know,
   But I'm standing on the roof just watching the show,
   Standing on the edge and my step belongs to me,
   And I'm telling you all I won't miss what I see.

   One foot over there's no time to turn around,
   Both feet are over and I'm heading for the ground,
   I'm flying in the air and I can feel the cool breeze,
   The people on the pavement have gone into a freeze,
   No space no time it's like walking on the moon,
   My heart is still beating but it won't be soon,
   I can hear myself scream when I hit the street,
   I can't feel a thing from my head to my feet,
   I told you I would do it and I didn't even cry,
   I feel more alive dead than when I was alive.

<h3>The Quiet Room</h3>

<pre>
   The California air
   Your nightgown on the stairs
   I remember every night
   Scenes from home in the Quiet Room

   How long have I been gone
   Did winter kill the lawn
   And all those polaroids you sent
   Are on the wall in the Quiet Room

   They've got this place
   Where they've been keeping me
   Where I can't hurt myself
   I can't get my wrists to bleed
   Just don't know why 
   Suicide appeals to me

   The Quiet Room
   Is sterilized and white
   It's like a tomb
   With just a moth stained naked night

   Plastic forks and spoon
   No laces in my shoes
   They all know what I tried to do
   Outside the Quiet Room

   This quiet place
   It ain't so new to me
   It's haunted atmosphere
   Has heard so many scream
   My home from home
   My twilight zone
   My strangest dream

   My confidant 
   I have confessed my life 
   The Quiet Room 
   Knows more about me than my wife

   They've got this place
   Where they've been keeping me
   Where I can't hurt myself
   I just can't
   I just can't get these damn wrists to bleed

   A mattress on the floor
   No handles on the door
   I really need nothing here
   I'm alone

<h2>Life Of Agony</h2>

<h3>My Eyes</h3>

<pre>

a little older, little wiser
with every breath i learn just a little more
and with all i've seen, i've finally made up my mind
enough of this world
enough blood in these eyes
so, so, so sick of this life

it's about time that i realized
release this hate from inside
enough blood in my eyes

call it what you will
call it suicide
disregard how you feel
i'm just freeing my mind
clench my teeth as i sleep
so, so, so sick of this life
cannot take, cannot fake
can't shake this blood from these eyes

all i have and all i will be
nevertheless i'll live for all eternity
'cause you can't eraee my words, can't erase my mind
you can't wipe out my thoughts
can't shake this blood from my eyes
so, so, so don't even try
just give me one good reason to live
i'll give you three to die
let's leave this world behind

<h3>Fade to Black</h3>

<pre>
   Life it seems, will fade away
   Drifting further every day
   Getting lost within myself
   Nothing matters no one else
   I have lost the will to live
   Simply nothing more to give
   There is nothing more for me
   Need the end to set me free

   Things are not what they used to be
   Missing one inside of me
   Deathly lost, this can't be real
   Cannot stand this hell I feel
   Emptiness is filling me
   To the point of agony
   Growing darkness taking dawn
   I was me, but now He's gone

   No one but me can save myself, but it's to late
   Now I can't think, think why I should even try

   Yesterday seems as though it never existed
   Death greets me warm, now I will just say goodbye

<h3>I Am a Rock</h3>

<p>By Paul Simon © 1965 Paul Simon </p>

<pre>
   A winter's day,
   In a deep and dark December:
   I am alone,
   Gazing from my window 
   To the streets below
   On a freshly fallen silent shroud of snow,
   I am a rock,
   I am an island.

   I've built walls,
   A fortress deep and mighty,
   That none may penetrate.
   I have no need of friendship; 
   Friendship causes pain.
   Its laughter and its loving I disdain.
   I am a rock,
   I am an island.

   Don't talk of love;
   I've heard the word before;
   It's sleeping in my memory
   And I won't disturb the slumber 
   Of feelings that have died.
   If I never loved I never would have cried.
   I am a rock,
   I am an island.

   I have my books
   And my poetry to protect me;
   I am shielded in my armor,
   Hiding in my room, 
   Safe within my womb.
   I touch no one and no one touches me.
   I am a rock,
   I am an island.

   And a rock can feel no pain;
   And an island never cries.

<h3>Asleep</h3>

<pre>        
   Sing me to sleep,
   Sing me to sleep;
   I'm tired and I,
   I want to go to bed.
   Sing me to sleep.
   Sing me to sleep,
   And then leave me alone,
   Don't try to wake me in the morning
   'Cause I will be gone.
   Don't feel bad for me,
   I want you to know,
   Deep in the cell of my heart,
   I will feel so glad to go.
   Sing me to sleep,
   Sing me to sleep.
   I don't want to wake up
   On my own anymore.
   Sing to me,
   Sing to me.
   I don't want to wake up,
   On my own anymore.
   Don't feel bad for me,
   I want you to know;
   Deep in the cell of my heart
   I really want to go.
   There is another world
   There is a better world
   Well, there must be,
   Well, there must be.
   Bye bye....

<h2>Suicidal Tendencies</h2>

<h3>Institutionalized</h3>

<pre>
Sometimes I try to do things, 
and it just doesn't work out the way i want it to 
and I get real frustrated, and like, I try hard to do it 
and I take my time and it just doesn't work out the way I want it to, 
it's like I concentrate on it real hard, and it just doesn't work out, 
and everything I do and everything I try it never turns out, 
it's like I need time to figure these things out, 
there's always someone there going, 
hey mike, you know, 
we been noticing you've been having alot of problems lately, 
you know, maybe get away, and like, maybe you should talk about it, 
you'd feel alot better, 
I go no, it's ok, you know, I'll figure it out, 
just leave me alone I'll figure it out, you know, 
I'll just work it out myself, and they go, 
well you know, if you wanna talk about it I'll be here you know, 
and you'll probably feel alot better if you talk about it, 
so why don't you talk about it, I go, no, I don't want to, 
I'm ok, I'll figure it out myself, 
but they just keep bugging me 
and they just keep bugging me, 
and it builds up inside,


So you're gonna be institutionalized
You'll come out brainwashed with bloodshot eyes
You won't have any say
They'll brainwash you until you see their way

I'm not crazy - institutionalized
You're the one who's crazy - institutionalized
You're driving me crazy - institutionalized
They stuck me in an institution
Said it was the only solution
To give me the needed professional help
To protect me from the enemy, myself

I was in my room and I was like just staring at the wall 
thinking about everything 
but then again I was thinking about nothing, 
and then my mom comes in 
and I didn't even know she was there 
and she calls my name and I didn't hear her 
and then she started screaming, 
MIKE, MIKE, and I go what, 
what's the matter, 
and she goes what's the matter with you? 
I go there's nothing wrong mom, 
and she goes don't give me that, you're on drugs, 
I go no mom, I'm not on drugs, I'm ok, I'm just thinking, 
why don't you get me a Pepsi?  
She goes, no, you're on drugs, 
I go mom, I'm okay, I'm just thinking, 
she goes no, you're not thinking, you're on drugs, 
normal people don't act that way.  
I go mom, just get me a Pepsi please, all I want is a Pepsi, 
and she wouldn't give it to me, 
all I wanted was a Pepsi, just one Pepsi, 
and she wouldn't give it to me, just a Pepsi.

They give you a white shirt with long sleeves
Tied around you're back, you're treated like thieves
Drug you up because they're lazy
It's too much work to help a crazy

I'm not crazy - institutionalized
You're the one who's crazy - institutionalized
You're driving me crazy - institutionalized
They stuck me in an institution
Said it was the only solution
To give me the needed professional help
To protect me from the enemy, myself

I was sitting in my room and my mom and my dad came in 
and they pulled up a chair and they sat down, they go, 
mike, we need to talk to you, 
I go okay, what's the matter?  
They go me and your mom, 
we been noticing lately you've been having alot of problems, 
and you've been going out for no reason, 
and we're afraid that you're going to hurt somebody, 
and we're afraid you're gonna hurt yourself, 
so we decided that it would be in your best interest 
if we put you somewhere where you could get the help that you need, 
and I go, 
wait, what are you talking about, 
we decided? my best interest? 
How do you know what MY best interest is?  
How can you say what MY best interest is?  
What are you trying to say? 
That I'm crazy? 
When I went to your schools, 
I went to your churches, 
I went to your institutional learning facilities.  
So how can you say I'm crazy?

They say they're gonna fix my brain
Alleviate my suffering and my pain
But by the time they fix my head
Mentally I'll be dead

I'm not crazy - institutionalized
You're the one who's crazy - institutionalized
You're driving me crazy - institutionalized
They stuck me in an institution
Said it was the only solution
To give me the needed professional help
To protect me from the enemy, myself

It doesn't matter, I'll probably get hit by a car anyway.

<h3>Suicidal Failure</h3>

<pre>
   Father forgive me for I know not what I do
   I tried everything, now I'll leave it up to you
   I don't wanna live, I don't know why
   I don't have no reasons, I just want to die

   I'm a suicidal failure, I gotta have some help
   I have suicidal tendencies, but I can't kill myself

   Tired of this way of life, my patience has expired
   I'm barely just 19, but my life I will retire
   I went down to a rifle store, I bought myself a gun
   I pointed it at my head, but I couldn't get the job done

   I'm a suicidal failure, I gotta have some help
   I have suicidal tendencies, but I can't kill myself

   I took all my mothers sleeping pills
   I jumped off a freeway bridge
   I drank three kinds of poison
   And drove my car off a ridge
   I beat myself with a bat
   Put a noose around my head
   I've overdosed on heroin
   But I'm still not dead

   I'm a suicidal failure, I gotta have some help
   I have suicidal tendencies, but I can't kill myself

   Death may not be the answer, it can't be all that great
   But me I'm not into living, with life I can't relate
   By some masochistic reasoning, I think it will be fun
   I want to start my second life now
   So shoot me with your gun
</pre>

<hr>

<h3>Suicide's An Alternative</h3>

<pre>
   Sick of people - no ones real
   Sick of chicks - they're all bitches
   Sick of you - you're too hip
   Sick of life - it sucks

   Suicide's an alternative

   Sick of trying - what's the point
   Sick of talking - no one listens
   Sick of listening - its all lies
   Sick of thinking - just end up confused
   Sick of moving - never get nowhere
   Sick of myself - don't wanna live
   Sick and tired - and no one cares
   Sick of life - it sucks

   Sick of politics - for the rich
   Sick of power - only oppresses
   Sick of government - full of tyrants
   Sick of school - total brainwash
   Sick of music - top 40 sucks
   Sick of myself - don't wanna live
   Sick and tired - and no one cares
   Sick of life - it sucks

   Suicide's an alternative

   Sick of life - it sucks
   Sick and tired - and no one cares
   Sick of myself - don't wanna live
   Sick of living - I'm gonna die
