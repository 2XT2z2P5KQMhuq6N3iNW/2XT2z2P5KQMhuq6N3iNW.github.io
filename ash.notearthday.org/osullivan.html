<p align="center">Within a little while from now<br>
If I&#146;m not feeling any less sour<br>
I promise myself to treat myself<br>
And visit a nearby tower<br>
And climbing to the top will throw myself off<br>
In an effort to make it clear to who<br>
Ever what it&#146;s like when you&#146;re shattered<br>
Left standing in the lurch by the church<br>
Where people saying: &quot;My God, that&#146;s tough<br>
She's stood him up&quot;<br>
No point in us remaining<br>
You may as well go home<br>
Cause I did on my own<br>
Alone again, naturally </p>

<p align="center">To think that only yesterday<br>
I was cheerful, bright and gay<br>
Looking forward to wouldn&#146;t do<br>
The role I was about to play<br>
But as if to knock me down<br>
Reality came around<br>
And without so much, as a mere touch<br>
Cut me into little pieces<br>
Leaving me to doubt<br>
About God and His mercy<br>
Or if He really does exist<br>
Why did He desert me<br>
And in my hour of need<br>
I truly am indeed Alone again, naturally </p>

<p align="center">It seems to me that there are more hearts<br>
broken in the world that can&#146;t be mended<br>
Left unattended<br>
What do we do? What do we do? </p>

<p align="center">Alone again, naturally </p>

<p align="center">And looking back over the years<br>
And whatever else that appears<br>
I remember I cried when my father died<br>
Never wishing to dry the tears<br>
And at sixty-five years old<br>
My mother, God rest her soul,<br>
Couldn&#146;t understand why the only man<br>
She had ever loved had been taken<br>
Leaving her to stop with the a heart so badly broken<br>
Despite encouragement from me<br>
No words were ever spoken<br>
And when she passed away<br>
I cried and cried all day<br>
Alone again, naturally<br>
Alone again, naturally </p>
