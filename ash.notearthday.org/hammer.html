<p align="center"></b><strong><font size="5">Three Poems of lost Love</font> </strong><br>
.<br>
<u><font SIZE="+1">Dream</font></u> <br>
.<br>
I dreamt of the end of us.<br>
Your resolve so absolute.<br>
Every word and every action, <br>
pushing me away from you.<br>
.<br>
I dreamt your love was gone.<br>
No more was I for you.<br>
There was no hope, no second chance, <br>
there was nothing I could do.<br>
.<br>
In despair and confusion <br>
I wandered the barren plains <br>
of a bleak and harsh existence,<br>
where nought but darkness remained.<br>
.<br>
I hated you yet I loved you, <br>
I cursed and swore and raged.<br>
You destroyed my life so suddenly <br>
and left me there to fade.<br>
.<br>
Out of the light and into darkness, <br>
my life had come apart, <br>
my seams unravelled, my heart laid bare, <br>
frozen by your frigid heart.<br>
.<br>
I wandered there for an eternity,<br>
no light or love to sustain <br>
my fragile existence.<br>
And here I yet remain.<br>
.<br>
I tried to awake, to enter the light, <br>
to escape this nightmare.<br>
I cried out for your help <br>
but you were no longer there.<br>
.<br>
So here am I, trapped, <br>
an exile from life and hope.<br>
Here in this unreal reality, <br>
awaiting death, agonising and slow.<br>
.<br>
In this dream I lost you, <br>
My beloved, my true love.<br>
In all the world nothing is dearer, <br>
than the love I no longer have.<br>
.<br>
....Hammer....<br>
.<br>
.<br>
.<br>
.<br>
<u><font SIZE="+1">My Dearest Love</font></u> .<br>
<br>
My mind can find no peace,<br>
it's tormented by thoughts of you.<br>
It consumes me with despair,<br>
for the loss of a love so true.<br>
.<br>
Why must I still love you? <br>
Why did you stop loving me? <br>
Why am I so powerless,<br>
unable to let go of thee?<br>
.<br>
I can't move on with life,<br>
I simply cannot do other,<br>
than mourn and lament <br>
the lost love of a lost lover.<br>
.<br>
Perhaps there's life after death <br>
but there is no life after this.<br>
My only hope is to be reborn,<br>
with your loving sweet kiss.<br>
.<br>
I would die for you a thousand deaths.<br>
I would live for you a thousand lives.<br>
And still I wait and still I hope <br>
that your love will materialise.<br>
.<br>
Please come back to me my dearest love.<br>
Find within your heart,<br>
a glimmer of tenderness,<br>
from which to make a new start.<br>
.<br>
Find this spark within <br>
and nurture it true <br>
until it blazes as brightly <br>
as my love does for you.<br>
.<br>
Then we can be together again.<br>
So perfect, pure and right,<br>
like the phoenix from the ashes <br>
rises to begin a perfect life.<br>
.<br>
....Hammer....<br>
.<br>
.<br>
.<br>
.<br>
<u><font SIZE="+1">Sweet Kiss</font></u> .<br>
Dig the fit deeper,<br>
my heart still beats.<br>
Whilst love still lives,<br>
its loss devours me.<br>
.<br>
I crave the sweet kiss,<br>
of steel in my vein.<br>
Promising oblivion,<br>
the answer to all pain.<br>
.<br>
There is only one ending,<br>
an O.D.<br>
of hammer.<br>
Any less won't suffice,<br>
co's dead men don't suffer.<br>
.<br>
You drove me away,<br>
So let this be our last kiss.<br>
Aim true, kick back,<br>
punch it in, don't miss.<br>
.<br>
I can't take the agony,<br>
I'm done with this.<br>
Let's say goodbye,<br>
with a sweet kiss. <br>
.<br>
....Hammer....<br>
