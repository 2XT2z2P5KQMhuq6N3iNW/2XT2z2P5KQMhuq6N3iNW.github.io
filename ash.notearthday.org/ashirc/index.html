<p class="irc_section_header">I. Intro and Purpose</p>
<p>The #alt.suicide.holiday channel had been relatively inactive for a period 
  of time after the creation of #alt.suicide.bus.stop. I was not around on IRC 
  to know the specifics of what happened during that time, but the important thing 
  is that the #alt.suicide.holiday channel is active again! </p>
<p>The purpose of this page is to provide users and ops of the channel with general 
  channel information and guidelines. </p>
<p class="irc_section_header">II. General Information</p>
<p>The number of people in the channel at any certain day or time seems to wax 
  and wane. This is normal for an IRC channel, just try again later if the few 
  that are there are idle or the conversation doesn't interest you. Remember that 
  this is an almost-real-time discussion group, and the topic of suicide is not 
  discussed 24/7. If you really feel you need to discuss something related to 
  suicide, just start doing it...if people are paying attention to the channel 
  then chances are you'll get a response from someone. </p>
<p>Users are advised, for legal reasons, not to specifically tell someone how 
  a method works (however, if you wish to accept responsibility for the possible 
  consequences of doing so, it's your call -- methods discussions are not disallowed 
  on the channel). Instead, refer the person to the <a href="../ashnazg.html">ash 
  website</a>, to <a href="http://www.suicidemethods.net/">Geo Stone's website</a>, 
  or any other site you think might provide the information that's being sought. 
</p>
<p class="irc_section_header">III. Channel Operators</p>
<p>Operator status is given to regulars I trust to take care of channel problems 
  while I'm (or they) are away or otherwise not able to deal with things. The 
  most basic requirement for being an operator is some knowledge of how things 
  work, such as how to place a ban and how to undo one. Other things include coming 
  to the channel regularly, being concerned about the welfare of the channel and 
  those who use it, being open to suggestions and being willing to do whatever 
  it takes to keep the peace while keeping hurt feelings to a minimum. Of course, 
  this is an idealized situation. In reality, the ops are ashers, and we all know 
  ashers can, at times, be more intense and emotional than most people. Try to 
  remember that the founder and the ops are volunteers, are ashers, and are trying 
  their best to maintain a peaceful and safe environment for everyone to chat. 
</p>
<p>Please take note of reasons I am not giving operator status: solely as a reward 
  for showing up a lot, because I want people to like me, because I want to get 
  a person to stay at the #alt.suicide.holiday channel or any number of other 
  reasons that are emotional and/or don't really have anything to do with running 
  the channel. </p>
<p>It bugs me that dalnet doesn't allow non-ops to see who has what status in 
  a channel, so I've decided to keep a weekly update. It is available at the <a href="http://pub66.ezboard.com/bashhole8806">ash-hole 
  web board</a>. There is also a weekly update of the akick list on this page. 
</p>
<p class="irc_section_header">IV. Channel Rules and Guide for Channel OPs</p>
<p>Under reconstruction... </p>
<p class="irc_section_header">V. Channel Politics</p>
<p>I've decided to move the discussion of channel problems, concerns, ideas, and decisions to the <a href="http://pub66.ezboard.com/bashhole8806"> ash-hole web board </a>. Anyone who is interested in participating is welcome, and registration is not necessary for posting (keeping in mind that abusive postings will be subject to moderation). </p>
