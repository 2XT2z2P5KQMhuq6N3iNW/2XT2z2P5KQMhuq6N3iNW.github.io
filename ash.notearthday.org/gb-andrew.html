<!-- page content here --><span lang="en-us">(Webspinner's note:&nbsp; the below 
was received in November of 2001 without a return email address.&nbsp; I have no 
way of knowing whether this person really did commit suicide or not.)</span></p>
<p class="poem-sig"></p>
<p>What to say... Well life hasn't been going too well I guess things don't work 
out the way u expects it to. Suicide has been on my mind. Quiet a few people 
online know bout my problem because I discuss it with them. In which case I' am 
sorry that it has come to this. None of you are responsible for my actions it 
was purely my decision. </p>
<p>My life hasn't been too good. Been single for 5 yrs. I have made many 
attempts every one of those attempts has failed. </p>
<p>I have few friends that last more than a year. It seems my life is better 
online anyone who meets me turns to failure, either after time or the first 
visit! </p>
<p>I got no job and any job that I did get didn't last. I got no money and any 
money I did have went mostly of people so that I could have fun with them. I 
don't think I asked for much in return and I get very little if anything in 
return. I'm a failure and I can't do anything right. </p>
<p>My life is soo messed up all I wanted was to have friends and hang out and go 
to clubs and parties. From a girl I would have liked to have know what it would 
have been like to of had a relationship to have some one that loves me. I'm 
sorry it ended this way and I'm sorry if caused any pain I don't mean to do that 
to anyone even though it has happened to me. I know it seems pathetic to some 
people but at least now I don't have to worry bout anything. </p>
<p>Mum, Dad, Sis and Family, I love u all xxx </p>
<p>P.S Remember I'll be in your hearts forever and I will never forgot those who 
I know that loved me. </p>
