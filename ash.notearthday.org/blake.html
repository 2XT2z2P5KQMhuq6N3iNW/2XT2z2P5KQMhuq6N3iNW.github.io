<p align="center">To see a world in a grain of sand<br>
And a heaven in a wild flower,<br>
Hold infinity in the palm of your hand<br>
And eternity in an hour. </p>

<p align="center">A robin redbreast in a cage<br>
Puts all Heaven in a rage.<br>
A dove house fill'd with doves and pigeons<br>
Shudders Hell thro' all its regions.<br>
A dog starv'd at his master's gate<br>
Predicts the ruin of the state.<br>
A horse misus'd upon the road<br>
Calls to Heaven for human blood.<br>
Each outcry of the hunted hare<br>
A fibre from the brain does tear.<br>
A skylark wounded in the wing,<br>
A Cherubim does cease to sing.<br>
The game cock clipp'd and arm'd for fight<br>
Does the rising Sun affright.<br>
Every wolf's and lion's howl<br>
Raises from Hell a human soul. </p>

<p align="center">He who respects the infant's faith<br>
Triumphs over Hell and Death.<br>
The child's toys and the old man's reasons<br>
Are the fruits of the two seasons.<br>
The questioner, who sits so sly,<br>
Shall never know how to reply.<br>
He who replies to words of doubt<br>
Doth put the light of Knowledge out.<br>
The strongest poison ever known<br>
Came from Caesar's laurel crown,<br>
Nought can deform the human race<br>
Like to the armour's iron brace.<br>
When gold and gems adorn the plow<br>
To peaceful arts shall Envy bow.<br>
A riddle or the cricket's cry<br>
Is to doubt a fit reply.<br>
The emmet's inch and eagle's mile<br>
Make lame Philosophy to smile.<br>
He who doubts from what he sees<br>
Will ne'er believe, do what you please.<br>
If the Sun and Moon should doubt,<br>
They'd immediately go out.<br>
To be in a passion you good may do,<br>
But no good if a passion is in you.<br>
The whore and gambler, by the state<br>
Licens'd, build that nation's fate.<br>
The harlot's cry from street to street,<br>
Shall weave Old England's winding sheet.<br>
The winner's shout, the loser's curse,<br>
Dance before dead England's hearse.<br>
<font color="#FFFF00"><a name="marc">Every</a> night and every morn<br>
Some to misery are born.<br>
Every morn and every night<br>
Some are born to sweet delight.<br>
Some are born to sweet delight,<br>
Some are born to endless night.</font><br>
We are led to believe a lie<br>
When we see not thro' the eye<br>
Which was born in a night to perish in a night,<br>
When the Soul slept in beams of light.<br>
God appears and God is light<br>
To those poor souls who dwell in night,<br>
But does a human form display<br>
To those who dwell in realms of day. </p>
