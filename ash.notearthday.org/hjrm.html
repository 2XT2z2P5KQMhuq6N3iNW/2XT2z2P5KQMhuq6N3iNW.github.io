<p align="center">Demons fighting<br>
Strike like lightning<br>
deep within my head<br>
Cannot stop the wrath they cause<br>
wishing I were dead<br>
Voices breathing<br>
my heart weeping<br>
from the force I can't defend<br>
Ungodly pain with no control<br>
laid upon my soul<br>
Pieces lost<br>
at any cost<br>
leave holes within my heart<br>
tears are weeping<br>
drowning, seeping<br>
when did this all start?<br>
I wonder why<br>
I cannot fly<br>
It's not like I haven't tried<br>
Why me?<br>
wish I could see<br>
what I've done to deserve this pain<br>
I'll never know<br>
until I go<br>
to a land that'll let me fly<br>
watching like a dove<br>
the few I love<br>
from far beyond the sky<br>
That day'll come soon<br>
just like the moon<br>
to light the darkened sky<br>
and when it starts<br>
I'll leave my heart<br>
And finally, I will fly.</p>

<p align="center">Children cry<br>
as hope has died<br>
all throughout the world<br>
tears have choken<br>
heart's being broken<br>
souls are tossed and hurled<br>
into the night<br>
of faded light<br>
the future you cannot see<br>
the past forgotten<br>
the present gone rotten<br>
wishing not to be<br>
children shooting<br>
people looting<br>
the world is a disgrace<br>
we were born to live<br>
but what can we give<br>
when we can't show our true face?<br>
love's just a word<br>
that goes unheard<br>
as many have lost their souls<br>
hate is a game<br>
to the demon's name<br>
so we lose sight of our goals<br>
what do we do<br>
when nothing seems true<br>
and we no longer believe<br>
nothing to offer<br>
and all will suffer<br>
yet noone cares to grieve<br>
bullets fired<br>
children hired<br>
to sell out in the street<br>
it's someone to trust<br>
jaded by the lust<br>
of all those that they meet<br>
My soul's gone to pot<br>
As all will rot<br>
I just wish I could leave<br>
We'll be &quot;saved&quot; they swear<br>
but noone cares<br>
What a tangled web we weave.</p>

<p align="center">My heart has been shadowed<br>
like an eclipse across the sun<br>
mind like a twisted maze<br>
a labyrinth of stone<br>
encaging me in becoming my protector<br>
from the emotions that rage within.<br>
My masks, I have a thousand<br>
worn each and every day<br>
for noone sees the face behind<br>
the face that's really me<br>
I can look into a mirror<br>
and see all the disgust<br>
the hatred and the shame<br>
though I never know quite who it is<br>
that is looking back at me<br>
a reflection?...perhaps<br>
an image of who you were?,<br>
who you are? who you want to be?<br>
or someone you no longer recognize<br>
a stranger who's taken your soul<br>
you wonder what's on the other side<br>
of the looking glass beyond<br>
or is it just a mirror<br>
with just a stranger<br>
staring back at me?</p>

<p align="center">How are the blind expected to see<br>
when darkness is all they know?<br>
How are the deaf expected to hear<br>
when they've never heard music flow?<br>
How are the mute expected to speak<br>
when they cannot make a sound?<br>
How are the vets expected to walk<br>
with limbs that were never found?<br>
It amazes me how easy it is<br>
for the obvious to be seen so clear<br>
but what is not seen, so quickly judged<br>
for they cannot see the fear<br>
How can you expect one who's ADD<br>
to focus at the drop of a hat?<br>
How can you expect someone with OCD<br>
to act &quot;normal&quot; just like that?<br>
How are those depressed expected to smile<br>
when that's what others do?<br>
How can you expect one with anxiety disorders<br>
to &quot;calm down&quot; just because you tell them to?<br>
It's a mystery how the world can be<br>
so blind, deaf, and dumb.<br>
To be quick to judge everybody else<br>
without taking a look at themselves<br>
The prejudice I see today<br>
is far beyond black and white<br>
What I'm wondering now<br>
as I sit here tonight<br>
How can you expect a better place<br>
in this world that's so-called &quot;his&quot;?<br>
If you are one to judge then take a good look<br>
and tell me what &quot;normal&quot; is.</p>

listening to a different tone<br>
wondering why I feel this way<br>
wishing I could fade away<br>
tears never fall within my eyes<br>
just deep in my heart &amp; from the skies<br>
wondering what it's like to feel<br>
the love of one that's truly real<br>
Been betrayed by so many I trusted<br>
left me with my heart so rusted<br>
from the tears<br>
and all my fears<br>
falling till I just can't stand the pain<br>
any longer it's just too much to take<br>
and I wonder why they all were so fake<br>
telling lies beneath their phony act<br>
thinking I'd never see as a matter of fact<br>
but I did<br>
and they left me with my tears<br>
crying harder in my fears<br>
and they went not looking back<br>
at my heart upon which they'd cracked<br>
they just kept on...<br>
...never looking back...</p>

Daniel rushes out on stage<br>
before his awaited fans.<br>
To flip and jump and summersault<br>
while children clapped their hands.
</p><p align="center">
The youngsters giggle with delight<br>
to watch him entertain.<br>
He fills their little hearts with joy<br>
as he rides the old toy train.
</p><p align="center">
His face is always painted<br>
with a smile and a big red nose.<br>
Except for the single tear he's drawn<br>
so small it hardly shows.
</p><p align="center">
Beneath the paint is what no one sees,<br>
the true face Daniel hides.<br>
For it's more than just a little tear <br>
that stream from Daniel's eyes.
</p><p align="center">
He's brought happiness to others,<br>
never found it for himself.<br>
The only friend he'd ever had<br>
was the bottle on the shelf.
</p><p align="center">
Now Daniel was a good man<br>
gave it everything he had.<br>
But now his soul is empty<br>
and his soul is lost and sad.
</p><p align="center">
He's done his show for thirteen years<br>
but he can no longer try.<br>
Saddened he walks to his tiny house<br>
and breathes a heavy sigh.
</p><p align="center">
He sits down in his easy chair,<br>
a drink lodged in his hand.<br>
Daniel sorts through his bag of tricks<br>
as the hourglass loses sand.
</p><p align="center">
Daniel picked up the only thing<br>
he knew would set him free.<br>
Wherever it would take him <br>
is where happiness would be.
</p><p align="center">
He calmly walked across the room<br>
with a blank look in his eye.<br>
A single tear fell silently<br>
as Daniel smiled and said<br>
Goodbye.

beyond the naked steel bars<br>
that have captured me.

The warmest touch,<br>

Numbed by the voice,<br>

A darkened call.<br>
Unmistakably frightening; though I am drawn,<br>

Dear "God"<br>
I know I'm not a saint.<br>
This life you've placed upon me<br>
is a picture I can't paint.<br>
I've never been a believer;<br>
I admit that much is true,<br>
but I now feel, as a last resort<br>
that I must turn to you.<br>
I've chased my hopes in circles<br>
trying to understand the past.<br>
Though each road that I follow<br>
has been harder than the last.<br>
I don't know what it is I've done<br>
or what's left for me to do,<br>
I can no longer offer apologies<br>
for feeling what is true.<br>
A childhood that has been erased,<br>
my life's been shocked away.<br>
A careless mistake made selfishly<br>
I'm at the end, so now I pray.<br>
As I lay me down tonight,<br>
please save me from this place.<br>
Forever wash it all away<br>
before they see my face.<br>
Let me fly beyond the stars;<br>
take me now so I may lie,<br>
apart from all this pain I bear,<br>
please "God", <br>
just let me die.

A simple white rose<br>
standing solitary<br>
within a mottled glass vase<br>
See its beauty<br>
its delicate petals<br>
as pure as silk<br>
Your eyes don't see<br>
what lies beneath<br>
because of the clouded glass<br>
what protects it<br>
what holds it together<br>
what is flowing though its veins<br>
The rose in the sun<br>
begins to fade<br>
as the petals drop one by one<br>
wilted and withered<br>
dried and lifeless<br>
What you must see<br>
when the petals have gone<br>
many will toss it away<br>
just take one more glance<br>
for you will see<br>
beneath it all<br>
looking through the glass<br>
the beauty of the rose<br>
still stands...<br>
solitary.

If only I could dream away<br>
For a lifetime find a place to stay<br>
I do not think I ask for much<br>
just once to feel love's true touch<br>
To find a place where I belong<br>
and in the moonlight, hear the song.<br>
The sweetness of the starlit sky<br>
If they can be there, why can't I?</p>

<p align="center">The words that go unspoken<br>
I keep locked within my heart<br>
The things I want to tell you<br>
but don't know where to start</P>
<P align="center">The feelings I wish I could express<br>
to give back all you share<br>
are hidden far beneath the chains<br>
too strong for me to bear</P>
<P align="center">The hardened grip that holds me back<br>
if only I could break<br>
it's grasp is much too powerful<br>
it's then my heart does ache</P>
<P align="center">I so want to return to it<br>
and show you what is true<br>
The only one who stopped beside<br>
and took the time was you</P>
<P align="center">I've walked a million miles<br>
taken every path that lay<br>
the only one that I recall was<br>
when mine crossed yours that day</P>
<P align="center">It was for that moment sense was made<br>
of the fog I treaded in<br>
that day I saw an angel<br>
and the grey began to thin</P>
<P align="center">That angel touched the wound inside<br>
I myself could never reach<br>
and for a moment I felt warm again<br>
as the moonlight on the beach</P>
<P align="center">Though reality may slip away<br>
that angel I won't forget<br>
a simple smile that meant so much<br>
I'm forever in her debt</P>
<P align="center">And now I sit and think of her<br>
to that angel this message I send<br>
I'm so very thankful for you<br>
My special angel friend.</p>

<P align="center">Goodbye doves and roses,<br>
Hello all alone<br>
I may cry but noone knows it<br>
I'll portray another tone</P>
<P align="center">You may say you love me<br>
But is love just a word?<br>
I may never find the real key<br>
what it is is just absurd?</P>
<P align="center">Forever is a time forgotten<br>
you'd think a memory would last so long<br>
What can you do when life turns rotten?<br>
everything you live for is wrong</P>
<P align="center">I can't seem to find a reason<br>
if I can't live for myself<br>
time can turn the change of season<br>
your heart's been left on a shelf</P>
<P align="center">You can't live for others<br>
despite how much you care<br>
they will always find another<br>
this time your heart won't feel the tear</P>
<P align="center">Gone against the ones who believe<br>
in god and heaven above<br>
Do I not have the right to leave<br>
without the pain of love?</P>

I'm sorry that I hurt you<br>
or caused you any pain<br>
The thought of ever losing you<br>
has me locked beneath the rain</P>
<P align="center">The words that are left unspoken<br>
will never once be read<br>
The feelings will be left behind<br>
in painful shades of red</P>
<P align="center">The tears that fall<br>
from bone dry eyes<br>
More crimson than blood red<br>
that stream from silent cries</P>
<P align="center">A broken heart can't soothe the pain<br>
from a love that once was stole<br>
drawn from wounds of frozen glass<br>
can never make it whole</P>
<P align="center">The doves are crying in their sweet song<br>
that never will be heard<br>
only when you fall that hard<br>
can you ever hear the bird</P>
<P align="center">Sitting alone and dreaming<br>
of those pearly gates<br>
but all you're left with in the end<br>
is feeling worthless dire straits</P>
<P align="center">Apologies are worthless<br>
when it comes down to the end<br>
but I cannot say "I love you"<br>
this is all that's left to send.

many lost because of you<br>
dancing beneath the moonlit sky<br>
now I sit hearing angels cry</P>
<P align="center">The rain now pouring down my face<br>
my heart hoping for saving grace<br>
the clouds coldly whisper my name<br>
at my life a story all in vain</P>
<P align="center">Memories of the jaded past<br>
memories that forever last<br>
childhood dreams that never came<br>
never knowing won't be the same</P>
<P align="center">Wandering about without a home<br>
wondering why I'm so alone<br>
chaos whipping through my mind<br>
hiding behind masks of every kind</P>
<P align="center">By myself I sit, will it ever end?<br>
slipping now as all descends<br>
questioning, stuck in this blackened tar<br>
I am bound forever behind these bars</P>
<P align="center">I take a swig from the old flask<br>
as I cower behind another mask<br>
the world carries on in foolish pride<br>
and again I'm the one that's left to hide.</P>

patched with blackened tar<br>
the hole you've left still opened<br>
burning through with cinders char</P>
<P align="center">The fist sized mark that's torn within<br>
I never will let show<br>
despite the heat it's chilled so numb<br>
the rain has turned to snow</P>
<P align="center">The words that say I love you<br>
I feel are said to mean true<br>
but they were but spoken words<br>
when they sadly came from you</P>
<P align="center">I wish I could've seen the truth<br>
at first when we had met<br>
but once again I was blinded<br>
and have not seen it yet</P>
<P align="center">Maybe one day I will find someone<br>
who is an honest, kind true friend<br>
but that day is oh so far away<br>
so now this is the end</P>
<P align="center">I look at my life and those I've met<br>
betrayal, vain and lies<br>
I think of you and wish I could say<br>
to you & the hurt and pain...good-bye.</P>

<P align="center">Alone,<br>
in a world I can't explain<br>
all the evil<br>
all the pain.<br>
My heart's<br>
been broke a thousand times<br>
like an unsettled beat<br>
or a rhyme.<br>
And I am lost in this mess<br>
left with so much distress<br>
longing to be free.</P>
<P align="center">Alone,<br>
in this ever changing life<br>
left to tear<br>
a single drop of strife.<br>
Beside me,<br>
there's an angel standing near<br>
saying it's not my time<br>
how can I live with all this fear?<br>
It is such a distraction<br>
burdened with all of this traction<br>
I just want to be free<br>
All I want is to be free.<br>
Just for a moment...to be free.</P>

a world, ever changing around you.<br>
You feel nothing,<br>
nothing matters anymore<br>
you've lost the fight,<br>
lost within the vicious circle<br>
that creates your being.<br>
Footprints walking in a forest<br>
darkened and alone<br>
it's claws moving in.<br>
You look around, there's noone there<br>
to stand beside you,<br>
to guide you<br>
on the path you are about to embark on.<br>
Slowly, you climb higher and higher,<br>
yet falling further with each step<br>
into a pit of solitude and despair.<br>
Trying to run,<br>
weighed down by heaviness<br>
within your heart.<br>
Your soul is dead,<br>
living in a lifeless body,<br>
dying in a lifeless body.</p>
