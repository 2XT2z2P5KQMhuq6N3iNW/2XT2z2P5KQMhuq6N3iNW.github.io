<h2 align="center">The Stone</h2>

<p>Heather sat alone in the dark, a grade-eleven chemistry text book still open beside
her, and cradling a small blackened rock in her hands. Her room was her only truly private
space, and she needed privacy most of all right now. She wanted to be alone and yet she
didn't; because she had been alone all her life, it just seemed most natural. She had
reached out in the past, and had kept pleasant company, but there were always so many
failings and hurts when she was with people; she couldn't force herself to be with anyone
this evening. Tonight she stayed inside, away from the people that could hurt her. She
didn't want to risk getting torn apart in the dangerous hustle and bustle of the outside
world.</p>

<p>She thought about her endless days of loneliness, of high hopes dashed when new friends
drift off for other relationships, and of lies and insults that cut her more than sticks
or stones ever could. When it had seemed like she was worth nothing, she had given herself
away cheaply, into the arms of boys who might love her, but invariably looted her for
personal profit before leaving her. She became the slut, as her father liked to tell her;
her mother merely argued without bringing up the issue of sex, but she brought up
everything else that was wrong with Heather. The few acquaintances that Heather could
claim as friends gave her little support, and when she became moody and depressed, they
didn't want her around at all. Her life was becoming quite useless and disposable. The
pain from years of abuse was becoming too much to bear.</p>

<p>But then, the other week, she had met a new friend at a friend's party -- someone two
years older, named Peter. He was Lisa's older brother, and was in his first year at
university. He had spoken words of understanding and compassion, and it had seemed to
Heather that she could trust him, and that he would care for her and be good to her, at
least as a friend. He was a good man. She had held out her very heart to him, in hopes
that he would take it carefully, and take time to understand it, and appreciate it, and
maybe help it grow. (She had left it in an envelope in his mailbox, unable to face him
with the embarrassing, pulsing mass in her open hands.)</p>

<p>Several days later, she dropped by his house to see him. They sat down together in his
room, he in a chair in the corner, and she on his bed. Heather glanced about the room,
pretending to admire his posters, but really looking around to see if he had put her gift
in a prominent place, or if perhaps he had it sitting on top of his desk from recent
study. It was nowhere to be seen. Her stomach twisted and turned as she thought about
asking him how he liked what she had given him, but she didn't want to show her
apprehension. She tried to ask him about his feelings on the matter off-handedly, as if in
passing, even though she was in desperate earnest.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, in fact, I did receive your package in the mail. It was quite beautiful.
What do you call it?&quot;</p>

<p>She was too embarrassed to say. But she took confidence in the fact that he liked it
enough to ask about it, and ignored the imprudence of his question. Instead she asked
Peter what he thought it might be.</p>

<p>&quot;I guess it seems to be some kind of glass trinket,&quot; he said in all
seriousness, &quot;for wearing about one's neck. I'm afraid I haven't gotten around to
putting it on a chain yet, though. Yes, indeed, a most charming little bit of
artwork.&quot;</p>

<p>Heather looked away from him, down at the threadbare carpet, then through the dirty
glass at the wild wide world. Her mind reeled at how crazy her life was becoming on this
confounded planet. &quot;Well, no,&quot; she answered him softly, lovingly, near tears.
&quot;It isn't really a trinket. I suppose you could say it is made of glass, and I'm glad
you found it beautiful, but. . . it isn't really what you think it is.&quot; She paused
and allowed the lump in her throat to settle. &quot;Do you really not understand it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry, I guess I'm just having a little trouble understanding it. I didn't do
so well there. I didn't really mean that bit about the necklace. I really think it is
wonderful, though. Did you make it yourself? I think you did a splendid job if you
did.&quot; Peter paused, waiting for her reaction to this compliment. &quot;It is very
beautiful,&quot; he continued. &quot;I congratulate you. I look forward to seeing more of
your work.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; she replied, again rather timidly, &quot;it isn't really my own work,
although I myself have put a lot of work into it. I think it's mostly the work of other
artists. You may notice where parts have been chipped and jaded? This is also the work of
various artists. But I'm not sure whether I'd really call it 'art', either. Honestly, does
it remind you of anything? Do you recognize it from anywhere?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I think I do recognize it a little from somewhere. I'm not sure where. . .
.&quot; Peter paused again, and looked up at the ceiling, his eyes narrowed in thought.
&quot;Pity about those jaded parts, though,&quot; he mused, looking back into her eyes
with sympathy. &quot;You really should do something about them.&quot;</p>

<p>Heather thought she could hear some compassion in his voice, and so she grasped it and
tried to tell him more. &quot;I suppose I've been trying to fix it. It's quite difficult,
though. Sometimes just when I think it's finally working properly, it fails on me, and
does something quite unexpected. I guess it's just too badly damaged to bother saving. I'm
thinking about discarding it. What do you think?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, you shouldn't just throw it away,&quot; Peter answered quickly. &quot;Perhaps
I can help. I am rather busy, but if you call and leave a message on my machine, I'm sure
we could set up a workshop appointment. I have an excellent set of tools for such work. In
fact, I happen to have an amazing 'one-size-fits-all' wrench and ratchet set, and I think
it would work wonders on this little bit of handiwork.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see. Hm.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But all that aside, is there anything else I can help you with? I do like to help
people, especially people as interesting as you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Um, if you wouldn't mind, I think I'd just like to take my little piece of
handiwork back for a few days. I can see that you appreciate it, and I'd love to lend it
to you again sometime, but not right now. I'm just afraid it might get broken again if I
leave it lying around somewhere. It's not that I don't trust you, but I know we'd both
feel bad if it got broken while you were borrowing it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Okay,&quot; he said, rising from his armchair. &quot;Thank you for lending it to
me, anyway.&quot;</p>

<p>At this point he went to his desk, shuffled through a few stained and wrinkled papers,
tossed aside an odd-looking wrench, shuffled through the papers again, and finally
produced the jewel. It had been knocked around a little bit while on his desk, having
things thrown on top of it etc etc, but it was still quite recognizable. She just wanted
it back in one piece, that was all. She reached out her hand to him and smiled
appreciatively.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; she half-whispered, as he held it out to her for her to
retrieve. But just at the last moment, the phone rang, and he turned to pick up the
receiver. He carelessly let her heart slip through his fingers, and it fell to the floor
with a sickening thud. She heard it crack, just as he said &quot;hello&quot; to his
friend. She stood dumbfounded for a moment, then leant over to pick it up. (It was still
in one piece, and could be mended, but it would take a long time, barring any new damage.)
She placed it gently into her handbag, and cushioned it with soft memories. There was an
awkward wait while Peter talked with his friend on the phone; after a minute she felt she
should go. (It was at that moment that she knew the damage was irreparable, and her heart
had to be discarded as waste.) She took hold of the door handle, and turned back to him to
let him know she was leaving. He noticed her, uttered something to the other end, then
placed his hand over the mouthpiece.</p>

<p>&quot;You heading out?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeh.&quot; She pulled the door open, and looked back at him again. &quot;Thanks
for your time,&quot; she said. &quot;I guess I'll be seeing you, whenever.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It was my pleasure. Come again anytime; I'd love to hear from you,&quot; he said.
&quot;Until then?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeh. Bye,&quot; she said, and left in a cloud of sadness.</p>

<hr align="center" width="20%">

<p>And so, that evening in the dark several days later, Heather sat in her room alone,
waiting for something or someone to tell her what to do. Her heart was too badly damaged
to tell her anything, and her head was getting a bit muddled as well, without her heart
there to guide it. She didn't trust either of them by this point.</p>

<p>The fracture in her heart wouldn't have been so bad, but it had been handled carelessly
all her life, and she didn't think it could take any more abuse. She had built walls
around it to protect it from outside invasion, but as her heart struggled to break free,
the walls were battered down from within, and they eventually became ineffective. Her
fortress was always falling, and she always rebuilt it, but after a while it seemed like
she wouldn't be able to keep up. The incident with Peter would be the last time ever that
she would let her heart escape from its prison.</p>

<p>Now, in the darkness, as she held the cracked, jaded, blackened rock that has once been
a source of life and joy, she made her decision final: it was not worth saving. She had
already made up a will and paid off her outstanding debts, so once she went over
everything in her head a few times, she made preparations to have the filthy offense put
to rest once and for all.</p>

<p>She turned on her bedside lamp, and wrote a note of explanation. It would be a very
messy situation, and she wanted to apologize in advance for any harm done. Heather signed
it, sealed it, addressed the envelope, then laid back into the softness of her bed. She
relaxed her stressed body into the thick comforter, knowing that she had met the end of
her troubles. The kitchen knife in her hand, she pressed the point firmly into the rock.
It shattered easily into a thousand pieces, spilling all over, and left quite a mess for
those who would come in the next morning.</p>

<p>Her heart had been seared and cracked far too often for there to be any kind of a clean
break.</p>
