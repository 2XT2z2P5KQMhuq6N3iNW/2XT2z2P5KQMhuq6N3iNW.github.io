<font color="#FF0000"><b>Blaming the Unlucky</b></font></h3>
<p>
there's a common pattern i'm starting to notice among
friends, acquaintances, family, and coworkers.
whenever someone is physically or psychologically ill
(not to mention someone who suicides), it is
eventually the ill person who is blamed for their own
misfortunes.</P>
<P>i guess it's a way people have of rationalizing why
some people are ill and some are well.  that way they
don't have to deal with their own potential
vulnerability to the same misfortune.</P>
<P>it's easier to blame the unlucky than to blame a
fundamentally unfair universe.</P>
<P>people may show initial empathy or compassion when one
is newly battling an illness or disorder (depression
certainly being one example).  however, after a few
months/years it's interesting to look around at the
people you know and recognize (sometimes quite
clearly) the "reason" each person has assigned to your
illness.  in many cases, they will blame you (on some
level) for having created or encouraged your own
misery.</P>
<P>now, i'm all for taking responsibility for ones own
reality and actions.  but blaming all victims for
their own bad luck is a cruel extreme of
self-responsibility. 
for example, i have one acquaintance who told me a
couple of years ago that i should try ECT.  since i
chose to NOT do that, she has since written me off as
someone who "doesn't really want to feel better." </P>
<P>another example:  my PhD acquaintances all agree that
the reason i've not been able to find a job in my
field is that i stopped at a masters degree.  if i'd
gotten that magical PhD, they think, i'd have lots of
jobs rolling in.  (and as a side note, they believe my
depression would then also lift.)</P>
<P>and then there are the myriad of people who are now
careful to explain to me that cancer is caused by 
<ol>
<li>not enough sleep,</li><li>too much sleep,</li><li>not eating
enough algae,</li><li>eating too many vitamins,</li><li>not
eating enough vitamins,</li></ol>etc.  people are very
"supportive" and "empathetic" when you first are
diagnosed with a disease.  after a while, they need to
start compartmentalizing you and your disease so that
you are neatly separated from them and they are
therefore "safe" from the fate that has befallen you.
<P>of course, everyone generally has evidence and good
reasons why they believe they are "right" in their judgment. </P>
<P>it's a self-protection thing, i guess.  it's also
blaming the victim.</P>
<P>"she was just asking to be raped; look at the size of
her breasts!" </P>
<P>"she was just asking for cancer; she never got into a
regular cardiovascular workout routine!"</P>
<P>"he was just depressed because he never *really*
believed in god; he just went to church for show."</P>
<P>i guess human beings need to feel secure and "right"
in their own lives.  by blaming the victims, we build
a false sense of invulnerability and security against
our fears. </p>
