<p align="center"><big><strong><font color="#FF0000">The Value of Meritorious Deeds</font></strong></big></p>

<p>I would like to offer advice to those who are suffering right now and who want life to
be a happier experience. I have tested this theory, and so far it is TRUE. For most
people, I hope that in your life, if there is one thing you never must learn, IT IS WHAT I
HAVE TO SAY RIGHT NOW. But if you are an a.s.h. troll, MEMORIZE THIS AND REPEAT IT TO
YOURSELF EVERY MONTH. 

<ol>
  <li><font color="#FFFF00">As you accumulate merit, you find that merit is empty, and life
    gets worse.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#FFFF00">To accumulate merit WORK HARD and do GOOD deeds.</font></li>
</ol>

<p>But don't just do good deeds. Don't just work hard. Do a LOT of good deeds. Work VERY
hard. Or work at deeds that will do good for a lot of people. For example, I work very
hard. I write user manuals for biomedical equipment. They will be translated into many
languages and will help others save lives all over the world. But when I come home at
night, I curl up in bed alone, wishing I could cry, because the world is barren,
meaningless, and empty. </p>

<p>And so, I personally do not guarantee that good things will start happening to you if
you work hard at doing good deeds (which is not strange in my opinion). I have been
testing this theory out for many years now. It has taken that much time to verify my two
statements above. If you want a universal law... Those two statements are part of it. </p>

<p>If you have a goal of working hard, doing your best, and performing at least five good
deeds a day, eventually others will burden you with all their work and troubles. I hope
you are feeling masochistic. I am sorry I can't be more specific. You must experience it
yourself to really understand what will happen to you. Skeptics and a.s.h. trolls...
please try it out. It will really change your opinion. </p>
