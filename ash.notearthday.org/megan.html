<p class="item-title">To Blame </p>
<P align="center">This pain...<br>
I wish it was an illusion<br>
My blood drips down the shower drain<br>
and my hands are getting cold<br>
I guess it doesn't matter if I'm sane<br>
or if Marilyn Mansons to blame<br>
cause livings just getting old<br>
I'm thinking of a time when love was real<br>
or when it had a meaning<br>
A time when I could feel<br>
and I wasn't numb or unseeing<br>
There's not enough blood for me<br>
as I slash and slash at the open wound<br>
Look what I did!!!! WON'T YOU SEE?<br>
I hope you treasure this moment dear<br>
because when you wake up<br>
I will no longer be here<br>
No, no ones to blame<br>
(not Manson or any other influence I held dear to me)<br>
But it's my own fault<br>
can't you people see?<br>
I lived and now I wish to die<br>
so leave me in peace<br>
and please tell mom not to cry<br>
This is my disease<br>
and this life was mine</P>
<hr color="#C0C0C0" width="30%">
<P align="center" class="item-title"><span lang="en-us">Untitled</span></P>
<P align="center">I sit and I think of all the things life has in store for me
<br>
but nobody is able to see exactly what I see <br>
No future, no promises, no love and no desires <br>
all I want is a peice of this worlds fire <br>
but you know how much I want die <br>
and people just keep telling me it will all be alright <br>
I don't feel like keeping up this fight <br>
I'm not sure what life is really all about <br>
but there's this one thing that I doubt <br>
it's not for me <br>
I don't want to keep going <br>
I just want a little time to decide when and why <br>
and nobody's giving it to me <br>
If only I could make the world see <br>
how hard it is to just be me <br>
I don't care about what others think <br>
but you make it seem like I am weak <br>
Just because I don't act like you <br>
just because I'm not sure what I'll be able to do <br>
just because I don't feel like living another day <br>
and just because I have never listened to a word you had to say <br>
I don't need your input <br>
this is my life and I'll figure it out <br>
You tell me to see and I look <br>
but I see nothing but your doubt <br>
You don't think I'll make it <br>
and neither do I <br>
I can't take anymore of this shit <br>
and I can't handle anymore of your lies <br>
I'm making up my mind <br>
to end my own life in my own time <br>
Don't try to stop me <br>
maybe tonight I'll finally be free <br>
&nbsp;</P>

<P align="center" class="item-title">If you cared....</p>
<p align="center">
If you cared, I wouldn't be here crying in lonliness<br>
If you cared, I wouldn't be slicing up my arm<br>
If you cared, you'd know this!</p>
<p align="center">
If you cared, I would be okay<br>
If you cared, I'd be asleep by now<br>
If you cared, I wouldn't have so much to say</p>
<p align="center">
Please... can you look closely?<br>
You'll see the brand new slashes against my skin<br>
If you loved me....you'd be able to see<br>
Please, look at my pain<br>
I hold it clear on my wrist</p>
<p align="center">
If you cared, I'd have myself to blame<br>
If you cared, I wouldn't always have to hold a fist<br>
If you cared, I wouldn't be going insane</p>
<p align="center">
If you cared, you'd save me from my self destruction<br>
If you cared, you'd be here holding me<br>
If you cared, I wouldn't have to do this</p>
<p align="center">
Please.... can you look closely?<br>
You'll see my heart, right here in your palm<br>
I wish you'd see<br>
Please look at my pain,<br>
I hold it clear in my eyes</p>
<p align="center">
If you cared, I'd still be here<br>
If you cared, you'd find my body<br>
This is only if you cared<br>
My dear, sweet... Johnny</P>
