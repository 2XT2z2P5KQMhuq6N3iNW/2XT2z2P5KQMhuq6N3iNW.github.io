</font></strong><font size="3">From childhood's hour I have not been<br>
As others were&#151;I have not seen<br>
As others saw&#151;I could not bring<br>
My passions from a common spring.<br>
From the same source I have not taken<br>
My sorrow; I could not awaken<br>
My heart to joy at the same tone;<br>
And all I lov'd, I lov'd alone.<br>
<em>Then</em>&#151;in my childhood&#151;in the dawn<br>
Of a most stormy life&#151;was drawn<br>
From ev'ry depth of good and ill<br>
The mystery which binds me still:<br>
From the torrent, or the fountain,<br>
From the red cliff of the mountain,<br>
From the sun that 'round me roll'd<br>
In its autumn tint of gold&#151;<br>
From the lightning in the sky<br>
As it pass'd me flying by&#151;<br>
From the thunder and the storm,<br>
And the cloud that took the form<br>
(When the rest of Heaven was blue)<br>
Of a demon in my view.</font><big><br>

<P ALIGN="center">
Hear the sledges with the bells&#151;
<BR>
Silver bells!
<BR>
What a world of merriment their melody foretells!
<BR>
How they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle,
<BR>
In the icy air of night!
<BR>
While the stars that oversprinkle
<BR>
All the heavens, seem to twinkle
<BR>
With a crystalline delight;
<BR>
Keeping time, time, time,
<BR>
In a sort of Runic rhyme,
<BR>
To the tintinnabulation that so musically wells
<BR>
From the bells, bells, bells, bells,
<BR>
Bells, bells, bells&#151;
<BR>
From the jingling and the tinkling of the bells.

<P ALIGN="center">
II

<P ALIGN="center">
Hear the mellow wedding bells,
<BR>
Golden bells!
<BR>
What a world of happiness their harmony foretells!
<BR>
Through the balmy air of night
<BR>
How they ring out their delight!
<BR>
From the molten&-golden notes,
<BR>
And an in tune,
<BR>
What a liquid ditty floats
<BR>
To the turtle-dove that listens, while she gloats
<BR>
On the moon!
<BR>
Oh, from out the sounding cells,
<BR>
What a gush of euphony voluminously wells!
<BR>
How it swells!
<BR>
How it dwells
<BR>
On the Future! how it tells
<BR>
Of the rapture that impels
<BR>
To the swinging and the ringing
<BR>
Of the bells, bells, bells,
<BR>
Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,
<BR>
Bells, bells, bells&#151;
<BR>
To the rhyming and the chiming of the bells!

<P ALIGN="center">

<P ALIGN="center">
Hear the loud alarum bells&#151;
<BR>
Brazen bells!
<BR>
What a tale of terror, now, their turbulency tells!
<BR>
In the startled ear of night
<BR>
How they scream out their affright!
<BR>
Too much horrified to speak,
<BR>
They can only shriek, shriek,
<BR>
Out of tune,
<BR>
In a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire,
<BR>
In a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic fire,
<BR>
Leaping higher, higher, higher,
<BR>
With a desperate desire,
<BR>
And a resolute endeavor,
<BR>
Now&#151;now to sit or never,
<BR>
By the side of the pale-faced moon.
<BR>
Oh, the bells, bells, bells!
<BR>
What a tale their terror tells
<BR>
Of Despair!
<BR>
How they clang, and clash, and roar!
<BR>
What a horror they outpour
<BR>
On the bosom of the palpitating air!
<BR>
Yet the ear it fully knows,
<BR>
By the twanging,
<BR>
And the clanging,
<BR>
How the danger ebbs and flows:
<BR>
Yet the ear distinctly tells,
<BR>
In the jangling,
<BR>
And the wrangling,
<BR>
How the danger sinks and swells,
<BR>
By the sinking or the swelling in the anger of the bells&#151;
<BR>
Of the bells&#151;
<BR>
Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,
<BR>
Bells, bells, bells&#151;
<BR>
In the clamor and the clangor of the bells!

<P ALIGN="center">

<P ALIGN="center">
Hear the tolling of the bells&#151;
<BR>
Iron Bells!
<BR>
What a world of solemn thought their monody compels!
<BR>
In the silence of the night,
<BR>
How we shiver with affright
<BR>
At the melancholy menace of their tone!
<BR>
For every sound that floats
<BR>
From the rust within their throats
<BR>
Is a groan.
<BR>
And the people&#151;ah, the people&#151;
<BR>
They that dwell up in the steeple,
<BR>
All Alone
<BR>
And who, tolling, tolling, tolling,
<BR>
In that muffled monotone,
<BR>
Feel a glory in so rolling
<BR>
On the human heart a stone&#151;
<BR>
They are neither man nor woman&#151;
<BR>
They are neither brute nor human&#151;
<BR>
They are Ghouls:
<BR>
And their king it is who tolls;
<BR>
And he rolls, rolls, rolls,
<BR>
Rolls
<BR>
A paean from the bells!
<BR>
And his merry bosom swells
<BR>
With the paean of the bells!
<BR>
And he dances, and he yells;
<BR>
Keeping time, time, time,
<BR>
In a sort of Runic rhyme,
<BR>
To the paean of the bells&#151;
<BR>
Of the bells:
<BR>
Keeping time, time, time,
<BR>
In a sort of Runic rhyme,
<BR>
To the throbbing of the bells&#151;
<BR>
Of the bells, bells, bells&#151;
<BR>
To the sobbing of the bells;
<BR>
Keeping time, time, time,
<BR>
As he knells, knells, knells,
<BR>
In a happy Runic rhyme,
<BR>
To the rolling of the bells&#151;
<BR>
Of the bells, bells, bells:
<BR>
To the tolling of the bells,
<BR>
Of the bells, bells, bells, bells&#151;
<BR>
Bells, bells, bells&#151;
<BR>
To the moaning and the groaning of the bells.
