<h3><font color="#FF0000">
..trust me on the back-ups</font></h3>

<p>Back up your hard drive.</p>

<p>If I could offer you only one tip for the future, backing up would be it.</p>

<p>The necessity of regular back-ups, is shown by the fact that your hard drive
has a MTBF printed on it, whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more
reliable than my own meandering experience.</p>

<p>I will dispense this advice now.</p>

<p>Enjoy the freedom and innocence of your newbieness.
Oh, never mind.   You will not understand the freedom and innocence of
newbieness until they have been overtaken by weary cynicism.</p>

<p>But trust me, in three months, you'll look back on <a href="http://groups.google.com/"> www.deja.com</a> at posts you
wrote and recall in a way you can't grasp now how much possibility lay
before you and how witty you really were.</p>

<p>You are not as bitter as you imagine.</p>

<p>Write one thing every day that is on topic.</p>

<p>Chat.</p>

<p>Don't be trollish in other peoples newsgroups;<br>
Don't put up with people who are trollish in yours.</p>

<p>Update your virus software.</p>

<p>Sometimes you're ahead, sometimes you're behind.<br>
The race is long and, in the end, it's only with yourself.</p>

<p>Remember the praise you receive.<br>
Forget the flames.<br>
If you succeed in doing this, tell me how.</p>

<p>Get a good monitor.</p>

<p>Be kind to your eyesight.<br>
You'll miss it when it's gone.</p>

<p>Maybe you'll lurk, maybe you won't.</p>

<p>Maybe you'll meet F2F, maybe you won't.</p>

<p>Whatever you do, don't congratulate yourself too much, or berate yourself
either.</p>

<p>Your choices are half chance.<br>
So are everybody else's.</p>

<p>Enjoy your internet access.<br>
Use it every way you can.<br>
Don't be afraid of it or of what other people think of it.<br>
It's a privilege, not a right.</p>

<p>Read the readme.txt, even if you don't follow it.</p>

<p>Do not read Unix man pages.
They will only make you feel stupid.</p>

<p>Get to know your fellow newsgroup posters.<br>
You never know when they'll be gone for good.</p>

<p>Understand that friends come and go, but with a precious few you should hold
on.</p>

<p>Post in <a href="news://rec.arts.sf.written.robert-jordan">rec.arts.sf.written.robert-jordan</a>, but leave before it makes you hard.<br>
Post in <a href="news://alt.fan.eddings"> alt.fan.eddings</a> but leave before it makes you soft.
Browse.</p>

<p>Accept certain inalienable truths:<br>
Spam will rise.<br>
Newsgroups will flamewar.<br>
You too will become an oldbie.</p>

<p>
And when you do, you'll fantasise that when you were a newbie, spam was rare, newsgroups were harmonious, and people read the
FAQ's.</p>

<p>Read the FAQ's.</p>

<p>Be careful with whose advice you buy, but be patient with those that supply it.</p>

<p>Advice is a form of nostalgia.</p>

<p>Dispensing it is a way of fishing the past from the logs, reformatting it, and recycling it for more than it's worth.</p>

<p>But trust me on the back-ups.</p>

<p>(with apologies to Mary Schmich)
