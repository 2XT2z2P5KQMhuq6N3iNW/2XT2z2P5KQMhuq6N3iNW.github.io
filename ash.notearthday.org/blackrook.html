<p>Keepsakes acquire emotions like nothing <br>
you know:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the rag absorbs water into<br>
itself, among its fibers, you can feel<br>
its Wetness (unlike a Sad doll);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a magnetic charge focuses its brute force, shoves<br>
that which it is like, drags in opposites.<br>
Could you feel a tragedy moisten your hand<br>
with its cold dampness?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does it physically stab at the hurt in your soul?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does it tug (as a child, frightened, yanks at his<br>
mother's long skirt) at the mother inside<br>
you for reassurance that you're still safe?<br>
</p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000"><strong>&quot;They give you this . . .&quot;<br>
</strong></font><br>
When Yahweh, your Lord, <br>
fancies music He <br>
Makes an instrument: <br>
skinny cat's gut stretched <br>
Taut by steel tuners <br>
till its high notes wail. <br>
When these cries grow boring He adds a burst <br>
Fierce electricity through thin wire veins <br>
<br>
till the Device itself <br>
Burns out of life. </p>

<p align="center"><strong><font color="#FF0000">Ode to a lost boy<br>
</font></strong>(by Ivan, father of the Black Rook)</p>

<p align="left">I look at his face in the coffin, Why has he left me? <br>
I think about how the brother he loved so much is now alone.<br>
I should have known that he was two and not one, Mal &amp; Jason, spirits sharing one
body, but battling for a soul.<br>
I need to know this Demon, Jason, that took my son away. How did he hide himself from me,
the one who should have seen him? <br>
I would have helped him vanquish Jason, if I only knew.<br>
I read his writings, seeking answers, but there are only more questions.<br>
I search the Internet seeking his thoughts, but find only his opinions.<br>
I listen to the music that gave him peace, but I am denied it.<br>
I sit in his room, and I want to be with him, but I know I can't.<br>
I close my eyes and I whisper his name, I want him to be near, but all<br>
I can feel is his pain. <br>
I want to hear him say &quot;Hi Dad&quot; just one more time, but his words escape me.<br>
I need to know if he has found the peace he sought, but I won't know for sure till I am
with him again.<br>
I seek the answers, but they are not outside, they are in me, in MY Mind.<br>
I gave him all that I thought that he wanted, but I gave him the demon seed too, not
knowing it was within him as it is in me.<br>
I seek Peace, but find only torment.<br>
I test the Depths of my Depression, have I started the descent into Hell again?<br>
I can feel the dark Specter drawing me to his bosom, the faceless one extends his arms to
me, but if I approach, he'll surely wrap
his cloak around me, is this how I will finally find peace?<br>
I touch his grave, and I want to be with him, but I can't go now.</p>
