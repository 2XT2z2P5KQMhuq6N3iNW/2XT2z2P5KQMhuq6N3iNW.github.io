<h1>about &amp;</h1>
<hr noshade>
<p>who is &amp; ?</p>
<p>at the time this page was written, &amp; was a university student, in his
fourth year of study in computer science</p>
<p>how can I contact &amp; ?</p>
<p>post to <a href="http://www.deja.com/group/alt.suicide.holiday">ash</a>, if he replies, you've
contacted him.</p>
<p>why is it that sometime &amp; posts replies to a whole lot of articles in a
single article ?</p>
<p>because the &amp; uses an anon remailer, which effectively means that he pays
for his net access in proportion to the number of articles of mail/news he
sends.</p>

<p align="center"><a name="What_s_wrong">What's wrong ?</a></p>
<p>What's wrong ?</p>
<p>What's wrong with me ?</p>
<p>Why am I letting them do this to me ?</p>
<p>Why don't I cry out when this pain cuts so deep ?<br>
.......Into the soft white squidgy<br>
.......bits, the bits that you can<br>
.......never work out the function<br>
.......of when disecting a mouse.<br>
They are maiming me<br>
.......Even if I feel better in<br>
.......the morning these<br>
.......lacerations will scar.<br>
With these accusations,<br>
.......I was too young to know<br>
.......better; I trusted them; I<br>
.......LOVED THEM; I thought they<br>
.......loved me; They still say<br>
.......they do.<br>
You pin me to the drying board<br>
.......I opened to him like a<br>
.......flower to the sun.</p>
<hr noshade>
<p align="center"><a name="Up_to_Speed">Up to Speed</a></p>
<p>Not<br>
Being quite up to speed<br>
She warned me</p>
<p>Against<br>
The evil of the world<br>
Myself</p>
<p>Not<br>
Being one to rock the boat<br>
....I screamed<br>
....``I love U<br>
....I love U<br>
....But please understand<br>
....I can't ever be<br>
....The daughter you never had<br>
....Nor the biologist<br>
....For the family name''<br>
I say nothing</p>
<hr noshade>
<p align="center"><a name="Sandy">Sandy</a></p>
<p>Of all the ways<br>
To find out</p>
<p>This<br>
.......is the worst<br>
I can imagine</p>
<p>Of all the<br>
Uncertainties</p>
<p>This<br>
.......may be the<br>
Most uncertain</p>
<p>Just below an article<br>
On the rates rise</p>
<p>Just beside a piece<br>
On shady salesmenship</p>
<p>Two lives end<br>
In flat</p>
<p>A gun is recovered<br>
Police aren't looking<br>
For anyone else</p>
<p>I didn't at first recognise<br>
Your name - we always called you</p>
<p>Sandy</p>
<p>I still don't recognise his<br>
Flying up is out of the question</p>
<p>They just wouldn't understand<br>
That night we spent<br>
While I was<br>
.....................screwing your sister<br>
But they'd ask, ernestly,<br>
For the truth</p>
<p>A truth they'd known forever<br>
And were looking for denial</p>
<p>They just wouldn't understand</p>
<hr noshade>
<p align="center"><a name="Otaki">Otaki</a></p>
<p>We raced, across the sanddunes at Otaki<br>
we walked in from the station</p>
<p>closer than friends<br>
more distant than lovers</p>
<p>each rebirth left you<br>
with a little less to give</p>
<p>each blossoming reft<br>
a wound that wouldn't heal</p>
<p>each waning stranded<br>
you in a sea of depression</p>
<p>each death killed<br>
you a little, a little</p>
<hr noshade>
<p align="center"><a name="Miss_W._Sword">Miss W. Sword</a> <!The name "Miss W. Sword" just another name for a Wilkinson Sword razor blade. I carried a razor blade around with me for about many years.></p>
<p>As you walk out you assure me<br>
I'll have no trouble replacing you.</p>
<p>I swear I'll never love another,<br>
But you laugh and turn away.</p>
<p>Sure enough, that very night,<br>
I'm alone with Miss W. Sword.</p>
<hr noshade>
<p align="center"><a name="I_look_at_him">I look at him</a></p>
<p>I look at him,<br>
By himself at the bar,<br>
And wonder<br>
If he's drinking to remember,<br>
Or drinking to forget.</p>
<p>And whether the straight scotch<br>
Is as strong a spirit<br>
As the one he's trying to drown.<br>
It won't be after he's cried into it.</p>
<p>And he looks up<br>
And he thinks he sees her in the mirror<br>
And the barman understands<br>
And pours drinks into him<br>
Like coins into a wishing well.</p>
<hr noshade>
<p align="center"><a name="Home">Home</a></p>
<p>I have returned to the egg that hatched me<br>
To find it cold and damp and vacant<br>
And the present occupants of the nest<br>
Are not whom they were when last I passed this way.</p>
<p>This is not the egg that hatched me,<br>
For it was full of joy and adventures,<br>
Of trees to be climbed and cupboards to be raided,<br>
Of stones to be thrown and paths to explore.</p>
<p>This is not the egg that hatched me,<br>
It smells of time, books and pot plants,<br>
No more does laughter echo these halls,<br>
No more is this a place for children.</p>
<hr noshade>
<p align="center"><a name="Falling">Falling</a></p>
<p>It's not the falling that kills you;<br>
It's how you stop at the bottom.</p>
<p>Cats can safely land on four feet;<br>
After falling thirty stories.</p>
<p>But if one falls head first;<br>
It'll land head first.</p>
<p>People have fallen from planes,<br>
Landed in snow drifts, and lived.</p>
<p>A fall of a foot can kill<br>
If there's a noose round your neck.</p>
<hr noshade>
<p align="center"><a name="birthmother">birthmother</a></p>
<p>at the time<br>
it was reasonable<br>
it was the only<br>
....... thing you could have done</p>
<p>you were single<br>
in a mans world<br>
with no one looking out for you</p>
<p>but later<br>
....... when your ship<br>
....... came over the ocean<br>
....... carrying family<br>
....... and forfillment</p>
<p>you had the<br>
....... time<br>
....... money<br>
....... resources<br>
....... support</p>
<p>but they lay idiol<br>
....... while Rome burnt</p>
<p>and that morning<br>
....... after i'd walked<br>
....... three times round<br>
....... the manicured block</p>
<p>you weren't to busy to say<br>
....... to say you weren't ready<br>
....... to say that<br>
you loved me<br>
you needed me<br>
you wanted to get to know me</p>
<p>but not yet<br>
not until<br>
....... you'd told your family<br>
....... you'd come to terms<br>
....... with me</p>
<p>terms like the fine print<br>
....... of a deed of disinheristance<br>
....... signed in my blood<br>
....... by my blood<br>
....... to keep me out</p>
<p>large weave nets<br>
....... catch large fish<br>
small weave nets<br>
....... catch small fish<br>
a cruel fine print<br>
....... catches humans in it's web</p>
<p>struggle<br>
....... or die<br>
....... or cut free</p>
<p>so that afternoon<br>
....... i call the Seekers<br>
....... and withdraw my name</p>
<p>they ring up a week later<br>
....... asking if i'd really withdrawn<br>
....... i say ``yes''<br>
....... get the feeling there is<br>
....... someone else in the room with the nice young woman with brown hair and
hazel eyes who'd been so helpful in my Search<br>
....... more to help her out of a difficult spot than from any real wish to talk</p>
<p>``put her on''<br>
....... someone fumbles the phone<br>
....... there's a breath<br>
....... it grows to pause - the kind of pause that hides under beauratic desks
waiting to snare the unsuspecting<br>
....... slowly i reach over<br>
....... touch the flash bar</p>
<p>the hum hides the tears<br>
and whiskey the sobs</p>

<p align="center"><a name="Call_of_the_Sea">Call of the Sea</a></p>
<p>The rain drums on the roof,<br>
Recounting a tale of woe.<br>
Distorted by a millennium of retellings,<br>
The words are forever lost,<br>
But the message is of the sea,<br>
Of ships storm tossed,<br>
Of shipwrecks and drowning men.</p>
<p>And the rain is the tears of the mothers,<br>
And the sweat of the orphans,<br>
And the blood of the lovers.</p>
<p>I turn up the radio, I don't want to hear<br>
How many times each sailor came up,<br>
Before going down that last time.</p>
<p>But the rain told on,<br>
And somewhere, someone listened,<br>
Some lost soul, looking for a destiny,<br>
And he answered the call,<br>
The age old call of The Sea.</p>

<p>Slow puncture: noun -- a hole in the tire of a car, bicycle etc. which waits
to observe the most inconvenient time to show itself [ 1936 from slow puncher --
boxing terminology ]</p>

<p>Little old ladies<br>
Are part of the conspiracy<br>
They know the things<br>
You've forgotten that<br>
You needed<br>
First thing this morning<br>
So when they greet you<br>
``Good morning''<br>
They're asserting they're<br>
Having a great time<br>
And you should'a<br>
Stayed in bed.<br>
</p>

<p align="center"><a name="_III">III</a></p>
<p>A cat lies at an odd angle<br>
A dried pool like a speech bubble<br>
Out it's arse<br>
&amp; a small weeping hole<br>
In the side of it's head.</p>
<p>Someone's pussy<br>
Beyond the reach<br>
of T.L.C.</p>

<p align="center"><a name="_IIII">IIII</a></p>
<p>The brighter colours<br>
Have been bleached<br>
Like driftwood<br>
On this urban strand line</p>
<p>The neon lights<br>
(<em>BUY ME | OWN ME |<br>
DRINK ME | EAT ME</em>)<br>
Fade in each others light.</p>
<p>What needs a bum a whore<br>
When he has a bottle<br>
a bag and a can of glue ?</p>

<p>A week night drunk<br>
Out to prove there's<br>
Life after marriage<br>
Holds a one man party</p>
<p><strong>I'm hip<br>
I'm fasionable<br>
I'm an attractive man<br>

<p>When You Look At Me</p>
<p>When you look at me,<br>
What, what do you see ?</p>
<p>Do you see these cuts,<br>
This blood on my face,<br>
Bruises big as walnuts ?</p>
<p>Do you see the welt,<br>
Inflicted on me<br>
By mine own tongue,<br>
The pain clearly spelt ?</p>
<p>When you look at me,<br>
You look at this face,<br>
How can you not see,<br>
These bleeding wounds,<br>
Their horrid degree ?</p>
<p>I wish you could see.</p>
