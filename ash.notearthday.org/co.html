<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000"><strong>Carbon Monoxide (CO) Poisoning As a Method
of Suicide</strong></font> </p>

<p>The following information reflects material I have researched from a variety of
sources. Many of the web-based sources are referenced by their URL at the end of this
document. </p>

<p><u><font color="#FFFF00">Part One: Life, Death and Gas</font></u> </p>

<p>Animal life depends upon oxygen. When we lose the availability of oxygen we asphyxiate
(suffocate). Common methods of asphyxia include drowning, strangulation, obstructed
airways, etc. Asphyxia can also be caused by the absence of oxygen in an environment where
we are free to breathe, inside a plastic bag, for example. </p>

<p>We produce carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) as a waste product. The body is very
sensitive to high levels of CO<sub>2</sub> and when present will begin an involuntary
reaction that includes panic and increased rate of breathing. You can try this with a
plastic bag over your head. In a minute or two you will become acutely aware that you need
to breathe fresh air, even though you have yet to experience oxygen deprivation, your body
has become aware of the high levels of CO<sub>2</sub> and is automatically alerting you to
seek fresher air. </p>

<p>Sometimes gases can replace oxygen and induce death without causing a CO<sub>2</sub>
panic reaction. Some of these gases are bioreactive gases and some are innocuous gases. </p>

<p>Innocuous gases, such as nitrogen (which makes up about 70% of the atmosphere) do not
cause the asphyxia panic that CO<sub>2</sub> does. Replacing oxygen with nitrogen will
cause death, but I do not know much about this. </p>

<p>Some bioreactive gases, such as nitrous oxide, produce specific reactions that are well
perceived at the time of poisoning. Nitrous oxide is widely used as an analgesic in
dentistry, it is commonly known as laughing gas. It produces a sense of euphoria and it
can easily be lethal. Another gas that is bioreactive is Carbon Monoxide (CO). CO is
commonly available, easily produced, colorless, tasteless and odorless. It can produce
some vague, flu-like symptoms before causing death. The order of symptoms that might occur
as someone dies of CO poisoning are: 

<ol>
  <li>Headache </li>
  <li>Dizziness </li>
  <li>Upset Stomach </li>
  <li>Clumsiness </li>
  <li>Drowsiness </li>
  <li>Brain Damage </li>
  <li>Death </li>
</ol>

<p><u><font color="#FFFF00">Part Two: Carbon Monoxide and Suicide: </font></u></p>

<p>The three principal advantages for CO poisoning for the suicide are: 

<ol>
  <li>Availability </li>
  <li>Lack of discomfort </li>
  <li>Speed </li>
</ol>

<p>Carbon monoxide is produced when anything ---ANYTHING--- is burned incompletely.
(Virtually all combustion is somewhat incomplete, so it is safe to say that anytime you
burn anything you produce CO.) The most common sources of accidental and suicidal deaths
by CO are automobiles and furnaces/hot water heaters, but CO can be used for suicide
wherever there is (1) combustion and (2) a contained area in which to collect the CO.
Other sources of CO that have caused poison deaths are fireplaces, gas clothes dryers,
ovens, stoves, space heaters, braziers, charcoal briquettes, etc. </p>

<p>The distribution of CO in a space depends upon a variety of factors. Your goal is to
have the highest possible partial pressure of CO, that is have CO be as large a part of
the total gases. It is best to plan on venting a space at a point farthest away from the
source. A single vent (low pressure) away from your source (high pressure). The effect of
CO is increased as heat and humidity are increased. </p>

<p>Concentrations of CO of 800 parts per million (ppm) can be lethal after three hours. At
6,400 ppm death occurs within 30 minutes or less. CO is better than oxygen at binding with
the hemoglobin in our red blood cells, hemoglobin is about 250 times more likely to bind
with CO than with oxygen. When CO and hemoglobin combine they produce carboxyhemoglobin.
This has a half life of five hours and concentrations of about 50% (half of the hemoglobin
is bound up as carboxyhemoglobin) produce death. According to the Haldane Equation, the
amount of carboxyhemoglobin, compared to hemoglobin, is about 210 times the amount of CO,
compared to oxygen. So, levels of one quarter of one percent (.25%) of CO in the air will
produce lethal levels (210 times .0025 = 52.5%) and higher levels will produce death more
quickly. </p>

<p>Perhaps it is simpler to say that it is fairly easy to produce a lethal level of CO. </p>

<p><u><font color="#FFFF00">Part Three: Choosing a Source for CO: </font></u></p>

<p>Your best bet for producing lethal levels of CO might be burning a charcoal grill in a
well insulated garage or room. Start it out-of-doors and burn it till you have a good bed
of glowing coals. Then move it indoors and close up the space, leaving only one small vent
open, away from the charcoal Heat and humidity speed up the poisoning process. </p>

<p>I have constructed a diverter for the flue from my hot water heater so that it will
vent into my living room. My hot water heater burns natural gas which produces a pleasant
(for me) smelling exhaust and I can use this method to die inside my home with only a
small risk of a fire. </p>

<p>Automobiles (or any devices with gas or diesel engines) produce adequate quantities of
CO. Diverting the exhaust into the passenger cabin of a car gives one the opportunity to
die in any variety of places, including a favorite scenic lookout, without putting others
at risk. Since 1975 in the US, and 1993 in the UK, passenger cars have been equipped with
required catalytic converters. The goal is to reduce the emission of CO, oxides of
nitrogen and unburned hydrocarbons. Depending upon the car, this is accomplished by
balancing the tuning of the carburation, use of catalysts in the catalytic converter and
injection of oxygen into the exhaust. The effectiveness of this system depends upon the
car being well tuned and the oxygen sensor being in good working order. Increasing the
carburetor mixture to &quot;rich&quot; or applying choke by operating a manual choke or by
defeating the automatic choke, will increase the amount of CO in the exhaust. Defeating
the oxygen sensor (which is designed to fail at 50,000 miles) or removing the catalytic
converter will also increase the CO content. In any event, a well-tuned car with emissions
controls in place will still produce adequate levels of CO to cause death, but it will
take longer. A cold engine will always produce a higher concentration of CO than a hot
engine. </p>

<p>With most methods you can allow the CO to build up, then enter the space after it has
reached high concentrations. </p>

<p>Whatever method you choose it should be easy to predict the length of time it takes to
produce and collect a lethal level of CO. You can use CO detectors (with digital
readouts), readily available at any hardware or home supply store, to measure the level of
CO accumulated over a period of time and the rate of increase. It is then easy to
extrapolate how long it will take to build up to the concentration you desire. </p>

<p><u><font color="#FFFF00">Accessories for Death by CO Poisoning </font></u></p>

<p>In about half the cases of suicide by CO (in automobiles) it was determined that
alcohol and/or drugs were present. You may be able to predict, but you will hardly be
sure, how long it will take before you become unconscious. During that time there may be
other exhaust fumes, humidity or warm temperatures. It seems to make sense to have some
drinks, drugs, music, etc. available for the minutes it will take to become unaware. </p>

want to check it out. Focus is on accidental death, but suicide is discussed on page 3 of
the site where it says suicide by car is depressingly easy.

A confusing site on auto emissions and CO published by the US EPA. I include this site
with some misgivings. The EPA is manipulating figures to give the appearance that car
exhaust is safe. It is safer, but it contains quite lethal levels of CO. Read this page
carefully and remember that figures don't lie, but liars figure. Use the information in
other sites to interpret the EPA claims. </p>

Manufacturers of CO detectors, this site gives basic information of home sources of CO and
describes how their sensors work and how they should be placed for good measurement. Good
information for those who want to test their system using a CO detector. </p>
