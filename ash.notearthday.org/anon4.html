<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000">realization of depression </font></p>

<pre>
want to escape
everything closing in
hide
it's been building
hide
under the desk?
attract too much attention
  can't do that
i'm a failure
i'm a fuckup
i'm worthless

it's built too much
i'm alone
everyone will leave me alone anyway
nobody will want me

what i'm worth
  i'm worth only for my stability
    or my perceived stability
  once that's gone
who will want

what is this
i've felt it before
i just hid it
it went away in a few days
never had a name for it

talking to a few people on the group
  more and more
    suddenly occurs to me this feeling
      has a name
        depression

hide
hide
hide

send an email to a friend
 asking her a quesiton about depression
  don't even bother to fix the spelling error

she says yes that's what it is
  that's what she feels
    like
  every morning
  every night

I wonder
  how the hell do people survive like this
  why the hell would someone want to make people
    survive like this

I call a friend
   a woman I used to go out with

     she has a masters in psych but no shingle so
       I can talk to her about it without risking a psych record

       she says if I feel like this after two more days I should
         go to a real psych

         riight.  like i'm going to do that.

         i don't mention i'm starting to think about how to tie a noose
         she's sounding a little too worried to handle that

hide

call another friend a little later
tell her how i feel silly about this
about this feeling
  when she and my other friend put up with it nearly every day
hell is hell she says
  it doesn't matter how often you're in it
  when you're in it you're in hell

but i still feel silly
i tell her that
she says she sometimes feels silly about it too
  that's just another nasty thing
    about depression

take a xanax
  the hospital gave it to me for heart palpitations
    half a year ago

      I still had three left now I have two left
      it helps a bit

go to bed
wake up

the feeling's diminished but it's still here
  wonder if it will get worse as the day wears on

hide
hide

wonder how productive i'll be today at work
probably not much

it's silly to be anonymous
the tears form at my desk at work
but i'm just not ready for everyone to know
  how i'm falling apart

hide.

    realized that once people are broken in certain ways, they can't ever be fixed, and this
    is something that nobody ever tells you when you are young and it never fails to surprise
    you as you grow older - as you see people in your life break one by one. You wonder when
    your turn is going to be, or if it's already happened.&quot;<br>
