<p>I am a camera</p>

<p>I have a history.<br>
&nbsp; And I am a semi-functioning camera.<br>
&nbsp; Sometimes the image being photographed was of such blinding intense light<br>
the film burnt out and the image was lost.<br>
<br>
There has been recent talk of siblings, families and parents.<br>
&nbsp; I have wanted to wade in with my own threepence worth.<br>
&nbsp; (But have felt my voice would be unheard, as I'm the fucking Joker round here).<br>
<br>
My original, natural, parents were both displaced from their homelands by<br>
the joint efforts of that nice Mr Hitler and Uncle Joe Stalin: my <br>
birth-mother was a German-speaking inhabitant of Prague, sent as a girl with<br>
her family to Austria; my birth-father was Ruthenian (oddly, the land of<br>
blond-wigged Warhol), and was also sent to Austria.<br>
&nbsp; In 1958, when I was conceived, he was forty-eight and she seventeen.&nbsp;&nbsp; He<br>
had a family, a wife and children, of his own.<br>
&nbsp; She was sent to UK to have me here.<br>
&nbsp; He took a gun to his head and finished it.<br>
&nbsp; She had me, and returned to Austria.<br>
&nbsp; (Nowadays abortion is quick and easy.....)</p>

<p>I was fostered by an absurd UK couple upon whom God had decreed<br>
infertility.......God had, in that small matter, been right.<br>
&nbsp; They were entirely unsuited to parenthood.<br>
&nbsp; They were both scientists.<br>
&nbsp; They saw me as an experiment, a blank slate from another culture.&nbsp; Such<br>
was the post-war horror of the theories of Naziism, the idea you might<br>
actually inherit anything genetically was quite revolting.&nbsp; All was nurture.</p>

<p>(There is a story here from my foster-mother's mother, who happened to be<br>
staying at the house when I was delivered.......not vaginally, you will<br>
understand, but by a nurse and retinue of officials in a car:&nbsp; the<br>
foster-grandmother dandled me fondly upon her knee; whereupon the<br>
foster-mother snatched me away with the words, 'He is not to be given any<br>
physical contact whatever lest it turns him into a Nancy.')</p>

<p>I was of course an immediate disappointment, and a Nancy (or Dorothy) I most<br>
certainly was.<br>
&nbsp; Thus began a reign of the most violent physical terror you can imagine.<br>
&nbsp; Not from the da.<br>
&nbsp; But from the ma.<br>
&nbsp; Physical violence towards your own children (except that I wasn't) is<br>
hardly excusable in ^any^ circumstances; but maybe it's easier to bear if at<br>
least there's a pattern to it, a predictability, a readable<br>
cause-and-effect.<br>
&nbsp; But there wasn't.<br>
&nbsp; I would be lashed out at for the least reason, and often for none.&nbsp; Many<br>
is the time my camera has chosen to forget, by overexposure, the family<br>
dinner table quite suddenly being thrust aside, amidst a clatter of plates<br>
and cutlery and food on the floor, so that the ma could seize me by the<br>
collar and beat me about the head and the shoulders.<br>
&nbsp; There was no rhyme or reason.&nbsp; Her own muddled head was all that decreed.<br>
&nbsp; (I don't believe I myself, for all my suicidal tendencies and intentions,<br>
am mentally 'ill': she was).</p>

<p>The da had an amusing habit during these incidents of somehow just not being<br>
there.&nbsp; He could shift his posture in his chair just ever so slightly so<br>
that he was gazing out of the window.&nbsp; Furniture might be smashing around<br>
him, plates breaking, food landing on the floor.&nbsp; His thirst for the line of<br>
least resistance meant he didn't comment; he was willing to see me<br>
sacrificed so he could keep sweet with her.</p>

<p>I may have painted a scene where this little poof-nancy-boy took it all<br>
defencelessly.<br>
&nbsp; Only so to an extent.<br>
&nbsp; I can't express strongly enough what determination I steeled up with.<br>
How much I hated them.<br>
&nbsp; Loathed them.<br>
&nbsp; Dreamed of living alone.<br>
&nbsp; Poof-boy developed an inner strong world, and promised himself that as<br>
soon as we was legally able he would leave..........</p>

<p>.........which happened.<br>
&nbsp; (In fact, poof-by was ordered to leave and informed never to return).</p>

<p>(So: was poof-boy a poof because:<br>
&nbsp; a:&nbsp; of the trauma of being divorced from his birth mother soon after birth?<br>
&nbsp; b:&nbsp; his proto-ma was domineering and his proto-pa weak?<br>
&nbsp; c:&nbsp; it was genetic, and proto-ma could smell it?)</p>

<p>Poof-boy then worked in London....life was a scream.<br>
&nbsp; Then in Madrid....scream?....it was an orgasm.<br>
&nbsp; Then in Nottingham, in order to get a house.....bit of a yawn.<br>
&nbsp; (Ouch: now it starts to hurt)<br>
&nbsp; Troubled times.&nbsp; Changing jobs.&nbsp; Drinking.&nbsp; Smoking pot.<br>
&nbsp; The iron will dissolving.<br>
&nbsp; Marriage.....(to a call girl).<br>
&nbsp; Several years out of 'official work', charging for 'school-room scenes',<br>
caning old men with a stick in my front room, shouting abuse at<br>
them.....they'd all say how realistic the lines I delivered were: (that's<br>
because the words were HER words).<br>
&nbsp; And now I seem to have drifted back into 'proper' work, farting about in a<br>
college talking about violence in the media.</p>

<p>I left them at the age of eighteen.&nbsp; I only once went back.&nbsp; (I like to<br>
pretend I've never been back).&nbsp; You could see Windsor Castle downriver from<br>
their house; Windsor Castle burnt down in '92.&nbsp; I got sentimental...(and<br>
wondered if anything might have come from those flames: well, forgive me - I<br>
was in Jungian analysis at the time)...and wrote.&nbsp; They replied.&nbsp; I visited:<br>
slept in my old bedroom.<br>
&nbsp; All seemed fine.<br>
&nbsp; I returned home to my own house, full of notions of the healthy process of<br>
reconciliation.<br>
&nbsp; Then I got a letter.<br>
&nbsp; She might as well have splayed me across the dining table and beat me<br>
about the head.....the violence she unleashed in that letter was<br>
devastating.<br>
&nbsp; Now, since then, there really hasn't been any contact at all; and when I<br>
die, pre-deceasing them, there's no record here of their address or their<br>
names.......they won't know.</p>

<p>There's a marvellous Italian movie, Cinema Paradiso, where the old man of<br>
the village says to the departing boy, 'Never return.'</p>

<p>Never Return.<br>
&nbsp; I can't think of one single event in my life where, for sentimental<br>
reasons of forgiveness, I have returned and then have found I had made the<br>
right decision.<br>
&nbsp; Not one.<br>
&nbsp; (Do not return to your vomit?)<br>
&nbsp; If you break away, stick with it.<br>
&nbsp; I have: (and I'm bitter).<br>
&nbsp; (If you stay put, and they help you out with your phone bill/rent/mortgage,<br>
or you know you will inherit their millions, the abuse they heap on you is<br>
the payback, and you have little right to complain: you either get out, go<br>
alone, and manage alone - or you accept the goodies and shut the fuck up).</p>

<p>I am a camera.<br>
&nbsp; But what I have seen has made me break.<br>
&nbsp; I hardly see anything now; I think maybe my lens is damaged.<br>
&nbsp; I am very very tired.<br>
&nbsp; I have hemmed myself in to a friendless-familyless corner.<br>
&nbsp; I can't say I regret that.<br>
&nbsp; But I do regret everything.<br>
&nbsp; And I am very very tired.<br>
&nbsp; I have never been in love: no one has ever told me he or she is in love<br>
with me.<br>
&nbsp; What more reason do I need to tell me it's time to go?<br>
&nbsp; And I never believed I might stop joking on ASH and say all this.</p>
