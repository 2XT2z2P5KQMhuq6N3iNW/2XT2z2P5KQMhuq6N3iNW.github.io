<p>alt.suicide.holiday (&quot;a.s.h&quot;) is an umoderated USENET newsgroup.
&quot;Unmoderated&quot;, in USENET terminology, means that there is no person or group
with the authority to approve or cancel posts. It does not mean that people within the
group may not show disapproval of posts which are at odds with the way the newsgroup
operates. If you are unfamiliar with general USENET principles, try reading <a HREF="news:news.answers">news.answers</a> for a few weeks. </p>

<p>The original <a href="charter.html">charter</a> of the group was to discuss suicide
methods and reasons; as it was believed that there were more than enough good reasons
connected with holiday times to kill oneself, the name alt.suicide.holiday was chosen.
&nbsp; It was assumed that traffic on the newsgroup would only occur around American
holiday periods.</p>

<p>The newsgroup has evolved into a partial sanctuary where people can discuss suicide
openly in an atmosphere which is not condemnatory of suicide, as much of
&quot;Western&quot; culture is. It is only a &quot;partial&quot; sanctuary as, being
unmoderated, the group has no mechanism to bar posts which seek to introduce condemnatory
viewpoints to the newsgroup. </p>

<p>Although a.s.h does not directly encourage suicide, it is viewed by some as encouraging
suicide by failure to discourage suicide and by providing information about effective
means, among many topics discussed. </p>

<p>a.s.h WWW operates under the same general principles. To store the more memorable of
posts, to be a reference center for the many diverse topics that a.s.h hosts, and also to
give a place where people can find links to related information. </p>

<p>Newcomers to this site, or to a.s.h should not view all the posters as suicidal,
although some are. It is strongly suggested that persons who want to post to a.s.h read
the <a href="http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/2150/intro.html">FAQ</a> and the &quot;<a href="http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/2150/std.html">debate</a>&quot; in full before
posting, however. </p>
