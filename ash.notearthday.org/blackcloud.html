Black Cloud

Some time ago, I lost my sight.
No more morning sun, it's always night.
There's a big, black cloud that's always
  following me around.
There's a big, black cloud that's always
  following me around.

It blocks out all the light, it brings the rain.
It blocks out all my heart, it brings the pain.
This big, black cloud that's always
  following me around.
This big, black cloud that's always
  following me around.

The pain is sharp as if, it's from a knife.
I hate this pain so much, I hate my life.
I hate this cloud that's always
  following me around.
I hate this cloud that's always
  following me around.

If I could cry I would, I'd let it out.
If I could die I would, I'd be without.
The big, black cloud that's always
  following me around.
The big, black cloud that's always
  following me around.

There's a big, black cloud that's always
  following me around.
I hate this cloud that's always
  following me around.

Mark - 1994
