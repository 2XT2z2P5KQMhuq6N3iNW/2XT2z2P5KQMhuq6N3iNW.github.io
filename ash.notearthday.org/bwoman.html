<p>Being the 'freak' that I am, I don't fit in too many places but ash has certainly been
a home for me. Back in Sep. 98, having only had my computer a little over 2 months, I
somehow found ash and it saved me. </p>

<p>I've been welcomed and welcomed others.<br>
I've laughed and cried. <br>
I've commented on everything and then lurked.<br>
I've learned and, hopefully, taught.<br>
I've spent late nights pouring my heart out and spent other late nights trying to comfort
others who've poured their hearts out.</p>

<p>I've come to know some of the most honest people I've ever encountered through ash and
even met one and hopefully am going to meet 2 more soon.</p>

<p>Ash feels more like a home than I have ever had where I was never encouraged or even
allowed to express any emotions.</p>

<p>I am always listening - and sometimes spouting off. I'm thankful, more than anyone
could ever know, for the existence of ash and its posters and lurkers. </p>
