<strong>
<p>The Release (Or, Killing Myself With An Overdose) (1994)</strong></p>
<pre>
Crying, sobbing, weeping
in the steamy bathroom
with my face on the cold counter top
and the water running 
My lungs aching for cool air again
My body denying.

One hand clenching a towel as if
it could save my life
As my mind trips back to the past
and torments my emotions
until I can no longer stand to think.

The tiles on the wall are
slick with moisture
(is it my tears?)
and I am falling
                falling
                        falling down
 and my hand falls open
        and I release
                my release.
</pre>

<strong>
<p>Mother (1) (1994)</strong></p>
<p>All her things<br>
are scattered<br>
over<br>
patchwork rugs<br>
and<br>
hardwood floors.<br>
Overturned<br>
and<br>
Underturned<br>
and<br>
Saddened eyes<br>
in her mirror,<br>
waiting.<br>
Fingerprints<br>
on<br>
half-dulled silver<br>
I am looking<br>
for one of hers.<br>
It's not there.<br>
Or not<br>
that I can see.<br>
Looking for her hair<br>
in a fine-toothed comb<br>
and wondering how it's<br>
still there.<br>
Smelling her soap<br>
and perfume<br>
but they dont<br>
smell the same<br>
without her warm skin<br>
to heat it.<br>
When the wind comes<br>
it will<br>
send the tears away.<br>
When the wind comes<br>
it will<br>
all feel better, soon.<br>
When the wind comes<br>
it will<br>
take the hurt away.<br>
</p>
<p>For now,<br>
there is silence,<br>
too loud<br>
and too long<br>
and too much to stand.<br>
</p>

<p><strong>Mother (2) (1994)</strong></p>
<p>My mother was a shining face<br>
in the crowd of people around me.<br>
She held my hand on the first day<br>
of kindergarten and she wiped<br>
my hands off on her pants<br>
before I ate the cookies she made.<br>
She taught me to read and write my name<br>
and didn't yell when I wrote it on the walls<br>
which she cleaned every day when I was young.<br>
</p>
<p>My mother was like an angel when<br>
she kissed my pains away and I can still<br>
remember the smell of her hands on my face<br>
when I was hot and feverish late at night.<br>
She taught me about the moon and lightning<br>
and frogs and spiders and shooting stars.<br>
</p>
<p>My mother told me how babies were born<br>
and how they grow and get old.<br>
She taught me how to be strong and bold<br>
and then my mother died.<br>

<p><strong>Silent Prey (1995)</strong></p>
<p>Take me in your arms,<br>
despite my crying words<br>
tell me that I'll be alright<br>
though I will not believe.<br>
</p>
<p>Promise me my sins are cleansed<br>
my soul - forgiven all<br>
Hold me in your arms,<br>
and promise me the world.<br>
</p>
<p>(I would sleep with you<br>
for the promise of attention<br>
I would sleep with you<br>
for a moment's warmth.)<br>
</p>
<p>Look me in the eyes and tell me<br>
That you never meant to hurt me<br>
Look me in the eyes and tell me<br>
that I haven't seen enough.<br>
</p>
<p>Hold my wrists when I try to slash<br>
Hold my hand when I try to fall<br>
Close my mouth when I try to swallow<br>
Burn the rope that threatens all.<br>
</p>
<p>(I would sleep with you<br>
to feel your arms around me<br>
I would sleep with you<br>
to make me real)<br>
</p>
<p>Promise me the heavens<br>
and I won't believe your words<br>
Promise me hell and I'll say<br>
I've seen it all.<br>
</p>
<p>I'll love you in a moment<br>
if you give me half a chance<br>
it's not good for me to do this<br>
but it's not like you to care.<br>
</p>
<p>So hold me in your strong arms<br>
for a moment it's all I need<br>
Hold me with your body<br>
and it will be the truth.<br>

<strong>
<p>What Have I become? (1995)</strong></p>
<pre>
	What have I become?

	Silence takes it's toll
	and soon there is no communication
	with angels
	
	You could have been everything
	and you could have been nothing
	
	My cloak of darkness doesn't
	effect anyone, but me 
	
		what have I become?

	He loved for no reason

	innocence lost, paradise gained
	paradise lost, innocence strayed.

	You could have been everything
	and still you are nothing.

	When I think about you
	there is no feeling
		no pain for my loss
		no wish for the past

	&quot;These people aren't your friends
	they're paid to kiss your feet&quot;			
	
		Need to pay them more,
		for I am sinking.

	White roses for the innocent
	Praying for the damned
		Should I tell them it's
			only a vicious cycle?

	You could have been everything to someone
	but you are nothing to anyone.

	With time, 
		we all fade
	and when we die
		we turn to dust

	..does it matter how fine the dust is?
	will we compete for the prize, even then?

	Give it all away
		material posessions won't save you
	and neither will your [G]od
	
	Your religious words of comfort won't keep
		me warm while I'm gone
	and the sound of your voice will elude me

	You could have been someone special
	but your presence doesn't count.

		He loved for no reason
		except the selfish need
		to do his good deed
		and move on
		Mercyfuckingkilltheyoung

	Sometimes closeness isn't there
	until you're fucking someone
	and then you're lost inside yourself
	but later you'll swear you felt 
	his love
		it was only pain.

	..and pain is what tells you you're alive
	so make yourself bleed
		tear the hole in your soul	  
		tear a hole in the sun
			blackness will surprise you
			the darkness brings the peace

	You could have been everything
	if you had only let yourself be free.
