</p>
<p>
Once upon time there was a boy.</p><p>
The aforementioned boy happened to be in a wrong place and was never wanted
by everyone. We all looked at him with disgust because he was too clever,
too brilliant and shining for his age. Thus we all thought "Well, this boy
is smart but won't be able to have a life."
</p><p>
The boy grew and became a teenager. Granted - he was clever but not
intelligent.</p><p>
Too often this boy was deprived of normal human emotions and too often he
felt all the pain people could give. And boy grew older and older, each
year receiving more and more into his part in this life. So teenager
struggled and struggled, tried and tried to breach the wall but couldn't do it.
</p><p>
As the boy grew older more and more he began to notice that his part in
this life was to suffer. This now clever young man spent hours studying
reasons why and why me but couldn't find his way out of the maze.
</p><p>
Years rolled by and our young hero grew older. After some work he was
granted a pension. As he sat in the dormitory room in the elderly home, shitting
and pissing into his pants in the wheelchair, abandoned by everyone he once
knew, abandoned by relatives and his obvious wife. And as the tears flowed
from his eyes old man asked in his heart: Why me?
</p><p>
Although last of his years this old man spent in relative care he spent
all his life thinking about his sad situation never being able to find
solution.</p><p>
Having gotten used to life in the dormitory dreams he started to pray to
new angel. Angel called "Death" by vulgar and "Comma" by those more
enlightened ones.</p><p>

Once as this old man sat in his wheelchair praying to "Comma" he appeared
and told there's only 10 minutes left before old man will be moved to
another plane of existence.</p>
<ul type="square">
<li>Comma, why did I have to live this long? Why didn't you visit me in my adolescence, where were you as I got siblings, where were you all the time?
Why you talk to me now when my whole life is wasted?"
</li></ul>
Comma thought a bit before answering. He thought with mercy this old man
now dying in the wheelchair, having lived a life where nothing good had
happened, chances deprived and emotional life destroyed beyond point of
no repair.
<ul type="square"><li>
Well, old man. I was there all the time - next to you. I gave you several
chances to come to me but no, you never heeded my call. I was there when
you got your first son, I was there next to you when you were crying and
sucking milk from your mother's breasts. I was there all the time but you
fool thought that things would be better!
</li><li>
But don't be afraid, old man. As with all of you who pray to me
and ask for answers I will have a mercy on you. Next life is like a
reflection   of this one you are about to leave. There you have a chance to be the one
who throws stones and strikes with a stick. So, do you want that?
</li></ul>
Old man sighed and thought about his miserable life. Comma offered him a
chance to strike back. For all his life this old man was haunted by other
people and now, at the elderly home dying alone he was given chance to get
even.
<ul type="square">
<li>
No, I don't want that. Old man replied.
</li><li>
How come? Isn't it after all fair? Am I not merciful enough?
</li><li>
Well, angel of mine, knowing you since the time of my birth, I think
getting even isn't the way I would be in hereafter. I have never been there before
and as I am now closing in... am I the only one? Isn't it so that each day
someone is born into this world and has to go through same misery as I had
to? Generations will come after me, generations will go after me. So, I
have a last wish. I have never wished for anything so I think asking this
one favor is enough, don't you think?
</li><li>
Go ahead, wish. I will grant you one wish before you will come with me.
</li><li>
Well, you know Comma, I have been thinking about life. Each day people
born and have to suffer... is it possible for you to remove instinct to
procreate? If it is, I wish for it. No child ever emerged from womb crying
aloud in joy - please remove suffering by removing the instinct to
procreate.<br><br>
For me it caused such a pain I have thought, you know, that if there are
no children and us adults grow older all the suffering eventually goes
away.<br><br>
So, that's my wish.<br>
</li><li>
Well... replied Comma. I can go for it. I'll set up trends against
procreation, make a fashion out of asexuality and then you will have your will
accomplished. One thing bothers me though - why didn't you ask for your enemies lives?
</li><li>
That would be too merciful for them.
</li><li>
Isn't dying sufficient fear?
</li><li>
Since you, Comma, have invented all the religions, all the papers and
so on I cannot think of better revenge than deprivation of siblings. And
in turn it isn't revenge either - it's just a way to remove suffering. My
life has been wasted already so I am just asking you to do a favor before
I go. It is a favor for all. Don't you think?
</li><li>
I will be out of business soon, old man, don't you know that?
</li><li>
Well, perhaps but that's my wish. Please, grant it unto me.
</li><li>
Ok then.
</li></ul>
Next morning old man was found from a wheelchair. His smile was shining
like a bright sun in the winter breeze, his hands were folded over his
breast.<p>
Staff took him out of his wheelchair and called to the relatives but found
out no one never knew this old man and would never know. So old man was
cremated and his ashes were cast into the wind. Few decades after that as
the last human was sitting in elderly home Comma took him away and thought:
</p><p>
"Well, wasn't this man clever. Now I am unemployed and my time has come
 to perish. If I only had known since the time of my career this I wouldn't
 have applied to this business ever."
</p><p>
And so death died.
</p><p>
The End.

<h3 align="center"><font color="#FF0000"><b>
VD (acronym for Valentine's Day and Venereal Disease)</b></font></h3>
<P>Don't you just hate it when it's supposed to be day of remembering friends
and you eventually notice you have already sent all the cards in time and
empty mailbox clings like a church bell before burial ceremony?</P>
<P>To ask What's wrong with me? isn't the answer, neither is blaming the former
people one considered as friends for leaving me out in the cold. If I could
warm my apartment with bits of solidfied loneliness and solace I would be
running nuclear power plant soon.</P>
<P>Granted, couple of SMS's arrived but still the feeling of loneliness and
solitude is beating the bones. Why do we act like this? Why do I act like
this? What's the point of arranging a day which is as painful to handle as
christmas and all the other days where you can see bunch of folks having fun
but you know that for some reason or other you just cannot jump into the
crowd and enjoy yourself, have a good time and so on.</P>
<P>You painfully just know the days that used to be and the situation back then
and now you just compare how it was like. But the days won't come back and
direction of time cannot be changed. It's an everflowing stream which during
the daytime swallows up crowd so that people drive around the street, on
their way to some place far away, then returning and doing the cycle again
and again each day, each night, each week, month, year, decade, century.</P>
<P>So what can you do? Look out of the window and notice the hotel booked full
and general signs of human life in your locale but that's about it - you are
alone, and even if humans could fly you would knew your window would be too
high, your window would be too dirty to look upon your misery.</P>
<P>And so you just think what's it all about - why me, why, why, why... what a
useless question! It's after all obvious - you were the one to be nailed
into the coffin, buried alive and you are just trying to grasp the threads
of life like a person striving for fresh air.</P>
<P>No, you don't get it - you breath, your cells exist, they interact and so
on. Only place where this social interaction exists is in each of your cell
which consist your body, brains directing your movements, your conscience
only friend in the hell of existence.</P>
<P>And looking upon time which is called future you instinctively know that it
won't get better. It was the same last year, and the year before that. And
so on. Later as you get older you still carry on remembrances of times that
are lagging behind. And eventually you just sit in your chair in elderly
house looking outside, suffering dementia and remembering how it was, it
used to be... and your failing nervous system just sends good memories so
you can sit in your wunderbaum and think of the things that won't come
again.</P>
<P>And so your life just fades, you eventually lose contact with outside world
and perish away like nothing ever happened, nobody comes to your funeral. If
you had a chance you could almost see the situation where people ask you:
where is that guy and you would answer: don't know, he never existed.
