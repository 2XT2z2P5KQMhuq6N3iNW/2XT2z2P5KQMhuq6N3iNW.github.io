The young man looked down at the poised blade, wanting and needing the
sweet release and completion of death.  His mind reverted to the beauty of
life and its paradox, knowing his mortality as a close and invited guest.
Life surged through his limbs as he stretched his arm away from his body,
the sweet instrument still seeking his heart.  Suddenly peace came to him
and he was at one with himself as well as nature.  He was truly dead even
as the blade sped it way through the air and drove itself into his chest.
As the inevitable blood gushed forth, he calmly removed the knife and laid
it down upon the tatami.  He leaned forward as his life ebbed away, and
died.  He was complete.
