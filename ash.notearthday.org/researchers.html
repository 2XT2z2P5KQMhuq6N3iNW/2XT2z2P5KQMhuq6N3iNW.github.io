<title>ashweb: We are people. We are not a research 'resource'.</title>

<meta NAME="Description" CONTENT="Some people view newsgroups as a resource, to be blithely posted to 
without bothering to research or read the FAQ or behave on the group in any sort of civilized manner.
Then these same people wonder why they are treated with equal rudeness.  Here's a clue.">

<p>I am NOT a guinea pig. I am not sitting here, writing everything so that I can become
part of someone's report on suicide. I am not sitting here spilling everything so that my
so-called friends can analyze me. If I wanted that, I'd toss myself into the nearest
hospital and tell them to fill me up with drugs and let me be comatose for a couple weeks.
</p>

<p>I am, however, pissed off. </p>

<p>I'm sick of e-mail from people in this newsgroup (lurkers, I assume) who write to me
and ask me whether I've tried counselling, or if I've &quot;found jesus&quot; or if my
parents ever abused me. </p>

<p>I'm sick of people who have absolutely NO real interest in the situation writing to me
to tell me that they think this group is &quot;neat&quot;.. I fail to see the
&quot;neatness&quot; of the whole concept. </p>

<p>I fail to see the novelty aspect, as well. </p>

<p>I fail to see how anyone can sit around in here and read a bunch of whining posts from
people like myself, people who can't die, won't die, don't know if it's time to die, want
to die, wish they were dead, etc.. </p>

<p>Where is the &quot;fun&quot; aspect of this? Rhetorical question, please don't bother
e-mailing me to tell me what I'm missing. I don't really WANT to know. </p>
