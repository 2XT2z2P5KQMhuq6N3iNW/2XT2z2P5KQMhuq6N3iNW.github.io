<h2>Ceiling=Lyric=Pentameter (<a href="mailto:churritz@cts.com">churritz@cts.com</a>)</h2>
<p>how may faces are there<br>
one two four six<br>
recessed and embossed in my ceiling wall<br>
for shame i haven't found you<br>
when loneliness is the only thing that fills this room
<p>it's three or four on a saturday afternoon<br>
it's cold outside<br>
though i'd rather be there than here<br>
you see going out in bad weather is good<br>
when the bad weather drives away all the people
<p>i believe i've set the record of staying in one place for the longest time<br>
but i'm sure i haven't<br>
there's proly someone out there more static thus more deserving<br>
since that's why i don't get anything good<br>
when everyone else says they are worse off<br>
<p>in counting the blob of hairs in my brush<br>
i realize i haven't been to a movie theatre in 3 years<br>
the last time i went was with my mom<br>
and the time before that i went with the person<br>
when it's the person that wants me to be this way
<p>i take no action on their behalf anymore<br>
even though the action i took was no more a bother than deleting mail messages<br>
i've seen too many stalking movies to be so self-rightuous<br>
but i still want them when i sleep<br>
when only the dark covers are the things that kiss me
<p>the blood<br>
that monsterous figure that forces me to deal with it<br>
if only i could let more out than i normally do<br>
then i wouldn't have to let out anymore<br>
when the dealing and living ceases so will the pain<br>
<p>everything is used<br>
everything is useless<br>
everything is needed<br>
everything is needless<br>
when the ceiling is the only one that stares back at you
