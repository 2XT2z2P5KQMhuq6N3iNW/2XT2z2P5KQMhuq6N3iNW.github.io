<font color="#FF0000">Guilt.
------
</font>
  How can I escape the memory of my friends?
  I hate myself, I hate myself
  Living in slavery to the ghosts that are inside;
  I hate myself, I hate myself
 
  Not enough eternity to fix the wasted time
  Hopeless faces walk away from rooms they tried
  to get inside
 
  Things that I want to forget about I bury
  I hate myself, I hate myself
  You bring me woe and worry
  and remind me to be sorry
  and hate myself
  so I hate myself
 
  These walls of memories define the wasted time
  Hopeless faces walk away from rooms they tried
  to get inside

  I can't seem to hold it in
  why can't I make this end?
  one more day in a world of shit
  time to get off this guilt trip
  
  stare down at concrete away from faces I can't feel
  I hate myself, I hate myself
  tearing up old photographs of people I can't touch
  I hate myself, I hate myself

  this stupid pantomime will always end in hell
  choked in the exhaust of a '74 chevelle, 
  or couldn't you tell?
 
  I can't seem to hold it in
  why can't I make this end?
  one more day in a world of shit
  time to get off this guilt trip

I think I'm going to Jennifer's house
we've had this thing going on for years
she makes people nervous, but I'm always anxious
to see how she's dressed, what kind of make up
she wears when she gets here
(to pick me up. oh...)

I always thought that she was the best, 
untouchable and cold
but she's really more inviting
and everybody knows someone
who she picked out on the street
took her out for a drink
and even though Jen doesn't have any heat
stayed for the night and blew off the next week with Jenny

I've got a big letch for what she's got for me
yeah, I'm a sucker for the love that she gives me
I can sleep in her arms, but I can't breathe
she's what it takes to satisfy me
she's what it takes to satisfy
she's what it takes to satisfy me
she's what it takes to satisfy

everywhere you take her turns into a mess
people complain about the cut of her dress
nobody likes her, so everybody worships her.

you see, I'm having this problem, unable to sleep
and I can only feel safe in Jennifer's arms
and she says that there's a place that's meant for me
inside her, oh inside

I think I know where I'm staying tonight
I think I know
I think I know what I'm doing tonight
I think I know
I think I know where I'm staying tonight
I think I know
I think I know what I'm doing tonight...

I've got a big letch for what she's got for me
yeah, I'm a sucker for the love that she gives me
I can sleep in her arms, but I can't breathe
she's what it takes to satisfy me
she's what it takes to satisfy
she's what it takes to satisfy me
she's what it takes to satisfy

I think I know where I'm staying tonight
I think I know
I think I know what I'm doing tonight
I think I know
I think I know where I'm staying tonight...

with Jenny, with Jenny...

fucking hell, it's a shell, but it's too late
i'm an idiot born from original sin
i know how to dig myself in a hole
cover myself and throw the dirt in

fun fun in the bathroom, it's all dumb
nothing i know that i don't hate
i've got these dreams that make me scream
i've got these thoughts that give me shame

with friends like these who needs enemies
cracking skull on my soul to get a taste
i grind my teeth when i'm asleep
i grind my teeth when i'm awake

like a bomb damage what i said i love
a pat on the back with a daggers sting
hold you close to beat you blind
with a leaded glove that's made of kidskin

fun fun in the bathroom, it's all dumb
when the drugs make you start to shiver and shake
i grind my teeth when i'm asleep
i grind my teeth when i'm awake

i'm awake.

<font color="#B020B0">(written after coming out of a weeklong coma)</font>

Chained to the bottom and the water's coming,
following the bubbles up, but only with my eyes
I'm sweating on the inside, I tell myself a lie
cause the water's cold and I am in way over my head, 
this time

These sharks can smell every taste of blood
and I know that everyone is somebody else's food
so what's the use?
If I can get to the surface, I can get to land
but that's another jail where I slowly rot away,
so here I stay
(hey, hey, hey)

My plans are starting to tighten around me
the air that I used to have is a memory
and I just want to go to sleep
how long before I dream?
how long until I can melt 
into the sea?

see the scars shine through the seams
these constellations grinning, 
no, you're not supposed to see
where I stopped to sketch the view
with a razor, excavating my skin
of the memory of you
