<p>Before I came to ASH I was existing in a lifetime's habit of never saying anything,
pass-timing, small-talking, how-do-you-do and what-do-you-do-ing. Of course, in all this,
I was actually talking a lot (but saying nothing) and making plenty of noise. Now I talk
very little (and my old friends think I am mute): but I wonder if I am now saying more. </p>

<p>I never thought a day would come when I would feel minded to say the things I have,
openly and publicly. And I never thought I'd see a day when I'd hear such things, and be
able to hear them, and be strong enough to read and re-read such things. </p>

<p>Maybe 'belonging' to ASH, in communion with other ASHers, has its paradoxes, not least
that I wonder if it has strengthened me. I came here originally, in March I think, merely
to research a method, very matter-of-factly: I'm still here in December, my method
perfected and filed away and almost forgotten. But something else has happened: I've
started to engage with other people, like I've never engaged before. That's why every time
I think I should be leaving ASH I just can't. </p>

<p>In March I could never have spoken the things I now do. In March I could never have
listened to the things I now do. What other posters have to say are so deeply dreadful,
far more dreadful than an ounce of my own experiences, and yet I find myself listening,
and listening without turning away in embarrassment: this is my ASH paradox, that by
coming here to find out how to die I seem to be stronger in my living. </p>

<p>Of course I still want to die. </p>

<p>Tell that to the Daisies with their certainties and their truths lifted straight out of
books. </p>
