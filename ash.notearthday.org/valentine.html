<p><i>[Note: this will undoubtedly mean very little to those of you in this world who do
not recognize this &quot;holiday&quot; which is the one of the unfortunate side effects of
an unabashed capitalistic society. However, if you like to break things, read on]</i></p>

<p>-*-Love-*-Love-*-Love-*-Love-*-Love-*-Love-*-Love-*-Love-*-Love-*- </p>

<p>Valentines Day... ah, the powerful emotions it doth evoke. Images of young lovers
holding hands, the exchange of flowers and heart shaped boxes of chocloate candy,
laughter, joy, love, love, love; all this coupled with the promise of the impending spring
thaw. </p>

<p>It's enough to make a free thinking individual want to gouge his own eyeballs out with
an old rusty pair of scissors. </p>

<p>You hate Valentine's Day. Every year you screw up your face in disgust when your eyes
fall on the center of your February calendar. Every year you glare in contempt and hatred
at these ignorant fools who buy into this money-making scheme of unabashed transparent
nothingess thinkly disguised as a day to show that special loved one just how much you
care, while leaving those of us who are not in the throes of love to feel rejected,
unloved, and downright inadequate. And those of you who are lucky enough to share the
companionship of another are very aware that passing this wretched date by unheeded will
result in scorn and contempt from your partner. </p>

<p>You've finally had enough, and you want to take action, but you are at a loss as of
what kind of action to take. In a stroke of rare generosity, I have compiled a list of
things you can do to make February 14 a tolerable, and even perhaps enjoyable, day for
those of who refuse to be enslaved by commercialism. 

<ol>
  <li>Firebomb all the Hallmark card shops you can find. The greeting card industry created
    this &quot;holiday&quot; and the most effective way of ridding ourselves of it is to
    destroy it at the source. Greeting card shops sell primarily paper goods, and will burn
    quite efficiently. </li>
  <li>Gather a large amount of sympathetic malcontents together and declare February 14 as a
    Day of Hate. Ridicule those who are less fortunate than you, refuel old ethnic hatred
    while encouraging the hate that already exists, explode an advertising binge of
    misanthropy. Be sure to be extremely vocal so as to get the attention of the media. Break
    lots of things with reckless abandon. Carry placards with catchy hateful slogans, such as
    &quot;Hate Is Great&quot;, &quot;Have You Exploited Someone Today?&quot; and &quot;Fuck
    Love&quot;. Hit the malls and be sure to torch all the greeting card shops (see (1)). This
    will have the positive side effect of destroying the malls where today's vacuous youth,
    extremely vulnerable to advertising, run rampant like a bad case of hives. </li>
  <li>Upon coming in contact with aforementioned amourous starry-eyed couples, proceed to
    exclaim loudly to either one, &quot;Why didn't you call me! You told me our passionate
    night together was only the beginning?! Who the hell is &lt;pointing to startled
    partner&gt; *this* cretin? Don't you know that s/he could never love you like I can?!
    You're coming with *me*!&quot; Etc., ad nauseum. Be very animated, and feel free to
    physically get in between these two clueless sots. To be especially effective, do your
    research ahead of time and seek out certian couples. Learn their names, their habits and
    lifestyles, and capitalize on this. By ruining their holiday of love together, you will be
    adding them to the ranks of bitter V.D. malcontents. </li>
</ol>

<p>You get the picture. Refuse to be passive! Join the ranks of the angry, the bitter, the
angstful, and smash this day into oblivion. You'll thank me for it in the end, I
guarantee. </p>

<p>-*-Hate-*-Hate-*-Hate-*-Hate-*-Hate-*-Hate-*-Hate-*-Hate-*-Hate-*- </p>

<p>This public service announcement was brough to you by Leigh Orf, angstful bitter
dissillusioned jaded malcontent at large. </p>
