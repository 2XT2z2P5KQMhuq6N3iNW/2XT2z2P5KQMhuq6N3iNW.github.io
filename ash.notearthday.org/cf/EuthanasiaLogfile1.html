<BR>[01:59] Session Ident: (nick deleted) <I>(IP deleted)</I>
<BR>[01:59] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) im just gonna say this once, cuz i need to say it to someone
<BR>[01:59] (OriginalSOPInAdditionToEuthanasia) ...?
<BR>[02:00] (OriginalSOPInAdditionToEuthanasia) say what?
<BR>[02:00] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) its bad enough I want to kill myself, but then when someone else offers to help kill me..that just really pisses me off
<BR>[02:00] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) ok i said it, 
<BR>[02:00] (OriginalSOPInAdditionToEuthanasia) offers?
<BR>[02:00] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) an no i dont feel better
<BR>[02:01] (OriginalSOPInAdditionToEuthanasia) who offered?
<BR>[02:01] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) yea, someone offerd to kill me all i had to do was live him everything.
<BR>[02:01] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) i cant say who cuz im new and hes not.
<BR>[02:01] (OriginalSOPInAdditionToEuthanasia) "live him"  you mean "leave him"?
<BR>[02:01] (OriginalSOPInAdditionToEuthanasia) someone in the channel?
<BR>[02:01] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) and i really dont want to start shit, but it just really irritates me.
<BR>[02:01] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) leave him sorry.
<BR>[02:01] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) yea
<BR>[02:02] (OriginalSOPInAdditionToEuthanasia) euthanasia44 by chance?
<BR>[02:02] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) i cant say who it is like i said i dont wanna start shit
<BR>[02:02] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) im not into homicide, not even my own.  just suicide, i know that sounds stupid. 
<BR>[02:02] (OriginalSOPInAdditionToEuthanasia) no, but if it's euth, you wouldn't be the first one who's mentioned it to me privately, but didn't want to 'start shit'
<BR>[02:03] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) i mean it wasnt so much the offer, it was the details that bothered the hell outa me
<BR>[02:03] (OriginalSOPInAdditionToEuthanasia) what details?
<BR>[02:03] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) i mean this person wants to drug me then drown me then dump me in a deep lake.
<BR>[02:04] (OriginalSOPInAdditionToEuthanasia) This is a bit disturbing...
<BR>[02:04] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) i cant see how anyone would want to participate in anything like that.
<BR>[02:04] (OriginalSOPInAdditionToEuthanasia) I know.
<BR>[02:04] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) i mean i can see me doing me, but i cant understand for the life of me why anyone would offer to do that.
<BR>[02:05] (OriginalSOPInAdditionToEuthanasia) for the thrill of it, I suppose...  I sort of wish they wouldn't hang around suicide channels though
<BR>[02:05] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) (makes me realize how fucked up this world really is)
<BR>[02:05] (OriginalSOPInAdditionToEuthanasia) Are you sure you don't want to mention who it is?
<BR>[02:06] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) yea im sure, what would be the point? 
<BR>[02:06] (OriginalSOPInAdditionToEuthanasia) so that we can get him out of the channel, so that he stops pissing people off
<BR>[02:06] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) im not pissed, im deeply saddened.
<BR>[02:06] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) and actually kinda nervous
<BR>[02:07] (OriginalSOPInAdditionToEuthanasia) why nervous?
<BR>[02:07] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) i mean if he is serious, and made the statement that well hinted that hes doen it before..
<BR>[02:07] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) i dont want to be associated with some psycho into killing people..even if they want to be dead ya know?
<BR>[02:08] (OriginalSOPInAdditionToEuthanasia) I know.  It's just friggin' creepy that there might be someone like that lurking here
<BR>[02:08] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) yea, and part of me really wants to do something about it.
<BR>[02:08] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) but the other part thinks maybe hes full of shit..
<BR>[02:09] (OriginalSOPInAdditionToEuthanasia) Maybe.  But this is the third time I've heard similar stories about someone in the channel
<BR>[02:09] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) and see now the ass has already pmd me right and wants to know if i wannna go through with his plan
<BR>[02:10] (OriginalSOPInAdditionToEuthanasia) You're talking to him now?
<BR>[02:11] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) yea
<BR>[02:13] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) ill send you the log...
<BR>[02:13] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) how the hell do i log?
<BR>[02:13] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) and then you go from there.

<BR>[02:15] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia)[21:13] (Euthanasia44) If it was murder it would, but this is something else, your going to die no matter what I do
<BR>[02:15] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia)[21:14] (Euthanasia44) it is assisted suicide the way I look at it

<BR>[02:16] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia)[21:15] (Euthanasia44) it is not murder if it is what you want
<BR>[02:16] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia)[21:15] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) i understand that, suicide, but it would be murder on your part..is that what you want?

<BR>[02:16] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia)[21:16] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) yes painless and peaceful is great.
<BR>[02:16] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia)[21:16] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) but why would you risk your life for me?
<BR>[02:17] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia)[21:16] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) i mean you are taking risks.
<BR>[02:17] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia)[21:17] (Euthanasia44) Yes, and is why you have to help me by co operating on not leaving a trail
<BR>[02:17] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia)[21:17] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) i understand that, but why risk your life..i mean nothing is perfect ya know, 
<BR>[02:17] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia)[21:18] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) im just asking
<BR>[02:17] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia)[21:18] (Euthanasia44) I try to minimize the risks
<BR>[02:17] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia)[21:18] (Euthanasia44) if you do your part, I will do mine
<BR>[02:17] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia)[21:19] (Euthanasia44) I think i can give you exactly what you want
<BR>[02:17] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia)[21:20] (Euthanasia44) So do you want me to work with you on it?
<BR>[02:18] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) another thing that bothers me <I>(nick deleted)</I>..
<BR>[02:18] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) is that he asked about my kids
<BR>[02:18] (OriginalSOPInAdditionToEuthanasia) ...?
<BR>[02:18] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) asked what i would do with them.
<BR>[02:18] (OriginalSOPInAdditionToEuthanasia) asked what?
<BR>[02:19] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) i avoided the subject, cuz i didnt want to even hear what he had to say about that
<BR>[02:19] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) but i got this really sick feeling, maybe im just being paranoid eh
<BR>[02:19] (OriginalSOPInAdditionToEuthanasia) May I show that log to stbdchick?  As I said, this is the third time I've heard things like this about euth
<BR>[02:20] (OriginalSOPInAdditionToEuthanasia) We ought to get him the hell out of the channel.
<BR>[02:20] (OriginalSOPInAdditionToEuthanasia) Nobody needs this sort of crap
<BR>[02:20] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) yea, but please this is the first place i feel like i kinda belong ya knw, i dont wanna start shit
<BR>[02:20] (OriginalSOPInAdditionToEuthanasia) I know
<BR>[02:21] (OriginalSOPInAdditionToEuthanasia) I'm not really sure how to handle this
<BR>[02:21] (OriginalSOPInAdditionToEuthanasia) Handle it without causing a huge disruption I mean, and without embarassinig you or the others
<BR>[02:22] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) fuck maybe ill just suicide out after you do it, this guys a nut
<BR>[02:23] (OriginalSOPInAdditionToEuthanasia) what did he say he was going to do with your body after he killed you?
<BR>[02:23] (OriginalSOPInAdditionToEuthanasia) I mean, how does he expect to get away with it?
<BR>[02:24] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) he said he would wrap it up and weigh me down with weights and throw me in lake tahoe, cuz its like 16,000 feet deep, and no one would find my body
<BR>[02:24] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) he wants me to rent a cabin up there
<BR>[02:24] (OriginalSOPInAdditionToEuthanasia) Up there: you're in hawaii?  Or am I thinking of someone else?
<BR>[02:25] (OriginalSOPInAdditionToEuthanasia) I can't think of where lake tahoe is
<BR>[02:25] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) yea im in hawaii
<BR>[02:25] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) its in california
<BR>[02:26] (OriginalSOPInAdditionToEuthanasia) He wants you to fly to calif so he can kill you???
<BR>[02:26] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) yea
<BR>[02:27] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) of course first he wants me to sale everything i own and give it to him when i met him at the cabin..
<BR>[02:27] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) and he is supposed to give me numbers to this cabin on this lake
<BR>[02:27] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) and the boat rental.
<BR>[02:27] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) so he can drag my body out to the lake
<BR>[02:28] (OriginalSOPInAdditionToEuthanasia) He certainly seems to expect a lot of you...
<BR>[02:29] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) well he says hes doing it for me
<BR>[02:29] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) so i can die a peaceful death
<BR>[02:29] (OriginalSOPInAdditionToEuthanasia) Hell, I'd be extremely cautious having *sex* with someone I met on the internet.  I'd hate to think of what he'd do once you were in his clutches.  If he's already planning to kill you, what's to stop him from torturing you for a month first?
<BR>[02:30] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) no shit.
<BR>[02:31] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) brb
<BR>[02:31] (OriginalSOPInAdditionToEuthanasia) k
