<BR>(WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) im making the choice to drink the drug you bring, yes.
<BR>(WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) to die peacefully.
<BR>(WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) but your drowning me...that makes it murder on your part..question is are you sure you can do that?
<BR>(Euthanasia22) Let me also ask you if you want it done the same day you arive? or do you want a day to relax first?
<BR>(Euthanasia22) You will die peacefuly, that is a promis you can be sure of
<BR>(WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) i duno never thought of it.
<BR>(WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) ok what type of drug are you using tho?
<BR>(Euthanasia22) I can do it, if I don't, you would do it in a not so painless peaceful way
<BR>(WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) what drugs are you using tho?
<BR>(WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) now if im asleep...and you put me under water, wont i wake up???
<BR>(Euthanasia22) I don't want to tell you the drug for fear you will try to od on it, it is better used to knowck you out
<BR>(WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) i am not going to try to od on anything.
<BR>(Euthanasia22) the problem with over doeses and why they are so unrelibale
<BR>(Euthanasia22) No
<BR>(WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) ok
<BR>(Euthanasia22) with this drug it is like being in a coma
<BR>(Euthanasia22) can't be awakend for hours
<BR>(Euthanasia22) you can't awaken and panic
<BR>(Euthanasia22) it will be peaceful as I have said
<BR>(WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) ok
<BR>(WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) so what i just drink the mixture you make and go to sleep
<BR>(Euthanasia22) the reason I ask you about when you would like to do it, there might be someone else that can be helped using the same cabin, but don't want you and her to meet, think your privicy is important
<BR>(Euthanasia22) Yes, with wine
<BR>(Euthanasia22) it would be in the wine
<BR>(Euthanasia22) and I would tell you
<BR>(Euthanasia22) not trick you at all
<BR>(WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) ok...
<BR>(WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) Someone else wants you to do this?
<BR>(WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) who?
<BR>(Euthanasia22) can't tell you
<BR>(Euthanasia22) and would never say anything about you either

<BR>(WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) well if i only rent the cabin for one day, how are you gonna work this?
<BR>(WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) it dont i said it was ok
<BR>(Euthanasia22) just someone else that also wants a peaceful death wich is not easy to get
<BR>(WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) ok.

<BR>(WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) well if im renting it for two weeks, that makes sense then
<BR>(WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) where, and how much is the question then
<BR>(Euthanasia22) If I understand you from talking before, you don't care about the money
<BR>(WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) naww money aint importiant.
<BR>(Euthanasia22) I told you, I'm looking at 2 places now
<BR>(WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) but i still need to know how much its gonna cost. and i need to make reservations n stuff
<BR>(Euthanasia22) between 1,500 per week,to 1,900
<BR>(WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) ok.
<BR>(Euthanasia22) forgot how much the deposit is
<BR>(WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) you said you were going to get me phone numbers for the cabin and the boat, you still gonna do this?
<BR>(Euthanasia22) but that is an idea
<BR>(Euthanasia22) Not yet until I decide on wich one
<BR>(Euthanasia22) and have to figure out how to do it without useing a credit card
<BR>(WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) i can take cash i spose
<BR>(Euthanasia22) can you get money orders with the credit card?

<BR>(WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) ok 
<BR>(Euthanasia22) I just have to make sure it is not traced
<BR>(WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) i thought you wanted money for doing this?
<BR>(WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) you said to sale everything.
<BR>(Euthanasia22) I want whatever you can have left over
<BR>(WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) like you said, i wont need it.
<BR>(Euthanasia22) bring me everything you can because you can't take it with you
<BR>(Euthanasia22) but not jewlry, can be traced to you
