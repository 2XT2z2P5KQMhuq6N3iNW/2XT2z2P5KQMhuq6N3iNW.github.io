Session Start: Fri Dec 15 16:16:43 2000
<BR>[16:16] Session Ident: Euthanasia44 <I>(IP deleted)</I>
<BR>[16:16] (Euthanasia44) Hi there.
<BR>[16:17] (stbdchick) hi
<BR>[16:17] (Euthanasia44) Who are you trying to talk out of suicide now? hahahaha
<BR>[16:17] (stbdchick) someone is having a bad time - maybe breaking up
<BR>[16:17] (Euthanasia44) I see
<BR>[16:18] (Euthanasia44) Well, are you ok with the <I>(nick2 deleted)</I> situation now?
<BR>[16:18] (stbdchick) I think so
<BR>[16:18] (Euthanasia44) Good
<BR>[16:19] (Euthanasia44) I think the first night should just be to visit and so on, then I will do her the next morning while your gone
<BR>[16:19] (Euthanasia44) I know you both want time together
<BR>[16:19] (stbdchick) why is she first?
<BR>[16:20] (Euthanasia44) Becasue she wants to be
<BR>[16:20] (Euthanasia44) and she wont do anything for me sexually
<BR>[16:20] (stbdchick) I dunno
<BR>[16:21] (Euthanasia44) what are you thinking?
<BR>[16:22] (stbdchick) I am typing to a depressed friend
<BR>[16:23] (Euthanasia44) I see
<BR>[16:25] * stbdchick sighs.
<BR>[16:26] (stbdchick) who the hell is gonna take care of all these people?
<BR>[16:26] (Euthanasia44) I have no idea
<BR>[16:26] (Euthanasia44) you could stick around you know?
<BR>[16:26] (stbdchick) I don't even mean when I die
<BR>[16:26] (stbdchick) even when I go back to work next week
<BR>[16:26] (Euthanasia44) Your going back?
<BR>[16:27] (stbdchick) yes, I go back to work on Monday
<BR>[16:27] (Euthanasia44) good
<BR>[16:27] (stbdchick) I don't have enough $ to stay out until we do this
<BR>[16:27] (Euthanasia44) make everything go back to normal
<BR>[16:27] (stbdchick) ha!
<BR>[16:27] (stbdchick) work was the last straw for me before
<BR>[16:28] (stbdchick) I hate my job
<BR>[16:28] (Euthanasia44) don't want people to know what your up too
<BR>[16:28] (stbdchick) true
<BR>[16:28] (Euthanasia44) Well, it's only until Feb
<BR>[16:28] (Euthanasia44) If you still want this that is
<BR>[16:28] (stbdchick) I still think Jan would be better
<BR>[16:29] (Euthanasia44) I know
<BR>[16:30] (Euthanasia44) this is not exactly like you would have it, but there are not a lot of options
<BR>[16:30] (stbdchick) why is jan not an option?
<BR>[16:30] (Euthanasia44) don't think there is 2 weeks open
<BR>[16:31] (stbdchick) please find out 
<BR>[16:31] (Euthanasia44) Jan 29 thru Feb 17
<BR>[16:31] (stbdchick) and... must be other cabins as well...
<BR>[16:31] (Euthanasia44) yes
<BR>[16:31] (Euthanasia44) you can look too
<BR>[16:32] (Euthanasia44) maybe you will find something I have not
<BR>[16:32] (Euthanasia44) I really feel more comfortable with planning for Feb.
<BR>[16:33] (stbdchick) why?
<BR>[16:33] (Euthanasia44) first part of Feb
<BR>[16:33] (Euthanasia44) You ahve made it this long, whats a few months?
<BR>[16:34] (Euthanasia44) gives <I>(nick2 deleted)</I> time to sell her things, and you time to come up with your money from your retirment account and so on
<BR>[16:34] (stbdchick) a few months in pain is an eternity
<BR>[16:35] (Euthanasia44) I'm still researching things too, like the grinder you don't want to talk about
<BR>[16:36] (Euthanasia44) I don't think I'm going to be willing to rush this if I'm not completly comfortable with knowing I can do this and not get cot by using the right equipment to get rid of remains
<BR>[16:36] (stbdchick) how is jan rushing?  that is weeks away
<BR>[16:36] (Euthanasia44) I'm sorry
<BR>[16:37] (Euthanasia44) I'm working on it
<BR>[16:37] (Euthanasia44) we will see
<BR>[16:37] (Euthanasia44) but I know your not happy about not being first
<BR>[16:37] (stbdchick) I feel creepy about their being corpses around
<BR>[16:38] (Euthanasia44) no body, just meat in teh fridge
<BR>[16:38] (Euthanasia44) if I get the grinder, it all will be done in a day
<BR>[16:38] (stbdchick) same thing though
<BR>[16:38] (Euthanasia44) so no body in the bath tub
<BR>[16:39] (Euthanasia44) Well, if you don't think you can handle it, you might not want to do this?
<BR>[16:39] (Euthanasia44) It's up to you, don't know what you can handle
<BR>[16:40] (Euthanasia44) you would be second however
<BR>[16:40] (stbdchick) http://www.malonestahoecabin.com/calendar.htm
<BR>[16:40] (stbdchick) it's available the 16-26
<BR>[16:40] (stbdchick) in january
<BR>[16:40] (Euthanasia44) I know, but it was wrong on the dates
<BR>[16:41] (Euthanasia44) that is 10 days, not 2 weeks
<BR>[16:41] (stbdchick) why is <I>(nick5 deleted)</I> last?
<BR>[16:42] (Euthanasia44) because she can handle being around dead bodies, and I could use her help maybe
<BR>[16:42] (Euthanasia44) Your to big for me to left by myself
<BR>[16:42] (Euthanasia44) I can handle the other 2 ok
<BR>[16:43] (Euthanasia44) So I might need a little assistance
<BR>[16:43] (Euthanasia44) Thats why
<BR>[16:43] (stbdchick) she doesn't know you're going to butcher us?
<BR>[16:43] (stbdchick) I mean, isn't she going to completly freak out when she finds out?
<BR>[16:44] (Euthanasia44) don't think so
<BR>[16:44] (Euthanasia44) but not going to tell her on the phone
<BR>[16:44] (Euthanasia44) someone who drank turpentine and was going to stabe herself in the tummy, probably wont have a problem with it
<BR>[16:45] (stbdchick) those are very different things, Euth
<BR>[16:45] (Euthanasia44) I know that
<BR>[16:45] (stbdchick) I was gonna hang myself, but would not be able to deal with corpses
<BR>[16:45] (Euthanasia44) I think she can handle it
<BR>[16:45] (stbdchick) I used to have to go to a slaughterhouse to get fresh calf brains for my research in grad school... couldn't stand it
<BR>[16:45] (stbdchick) and I didn't see anything
<BR>[16:46] (Euthanasia44) well, after you hang, you wont have to worry about it
<BR>[16:46] (Euthanasia44) but better not if you want her to get the money some day
<BR>[16:47] (Euthanasia44) just don't open the fridge
<BR>[16:47] (stbdchick) heh
<BR>[16:47] (Euthanasia44) We will just pretend she went home
<BR>[16:47] (stbdchick) get a cooler to keep soda in
<BR>[16:48] (stbdchick) so I can ignore the fridge
<BR>[16:48] (Euthanasia44) I'm thinking about that
<BR>[16:49] (Euthanasia44) might buy a small fridge there somewhere
<BR>[16:50] (stbdchick) no need for a small fridge
<BR>[16:50] (stbdchick) just a big styrofoam cooler
<BR>[16:50] (Euthanasia44) it is a big place, so just pretend she went home
<BR>[16:50] (Euthanasia44) sure
<BR>[16:50] (Euthanasia44) don't remember if there is a garage
<BR>[16:51] (Euthanasia44) the tempeture would be very cold in a garage
<BR>[16:51] (Euthanasia44) can put the cooler on the patio as well
<BR>[16:51] (Euthanasia44) it will be snow and very cold outside
<BR>[16:52] (Euthanasia44) So very good idea
<BR>[16:52] (Euthanasia44) it is such a nice house
<BR>[16:52] (Euthanasia44) 2 fireplaces
<BR>[16:52] (stbdchick) it's a gorgeous house
<BR>[16:53] (Euthanasia44) So you will have a very nice three or four days of the end of your life there.
<BR>[16:53] (Euthanasia44) peaceful
<BR>[16:54] (stbdchick) 3 or 4 days?
<BR>[16:54] (Euthanasia44) yep
<BR>[16:54] (Euthanasia44) we talked about that remember?
<BR>[16:55] (Euthanasia44) No need to kill you until ready to eat you
<BR>[16:55] (Euthanasia44) I will be eating <I>(nick2 deleted)</I> for the first three or four days
<BR>[16:55] (Euthanasia44) then you, and lst <I>(nick5 deleted)</I>
<BR>[16:56] (Euthanasia44) we talked about it
<BR>[16:56] (Euthanasia44) what are you thinking?
<BR>[16:59] (stbdchick) crisis... guy threatening suicide NOW
<BR>[16:59] (Euthanasia44) here, let him use my gun
<BR>[16:59] (stbdchick) not funny
<BR>[17:00] (Euthanasia44) hmmmmm
<BR>[17:06] (stbdchick) dammit
<BR>[17:06] (stbdchick) I hate this shit
<BR>[17:06] (stbdchick) why the HELL are there so damned many good, decent people that are this miserable?
<BR>[17:07] (Euthanasia44) Yes, and your one of them
<BR>Session Close: Fri Dec 15 17:14:31 2000<
<P>

Session Start: Fri Dec 15 19:01:49 2000
<BR>[19:01] Session Ident: Euthanasia44 <I>(IP deleted)</I>
<BR>[19:01] (Euthanasia44) So hows it going?
<BR>[19:02] (stbdchick) well... one friend is on the phone with the other friend trying to talk him out of it
<BR>[19:02] (stbdchick) I am providing moral support
<BR>[19:02] (Euthanasia44) I see, <I>(nick2 deleted)</I> has not called me.
<BR>[19:02] (stbdchick) she hasn't?
<BR>[19:02] (stbdchick) she hasn't been back online either
<BR>[19:03] (Euthanasia44) I do know she has distractions she can do nothing about, but I really want to hear her voice and talk to her.
<BR>[19:04] (Euthanasia44) I wonder if when we get together you will try to talk <I>(nick2 deleted)</I> out of doing it?
<BR>[19:05] (Euthanasia44) Like you say, you want no one but you to die, hahha
<BR>[19:05] (stbdchick) I need to talk to her a bit more, I think
<BR>[19:05] (stbdchick) and make sure
<BR>[19:05] (Euthanasia44) I hope you can accept her choice if it is to do it.
<BR>[19:06] (stbdchick) if she is certain
<BR>[19:06] (stbdchick) I have to be certain that she is certain tho
<BR>[19:07] (Euthanasia44) What if your not certain?
<BR>[19:07] (stbdchick) if I'm not certain, I can't be there
<BR>[19:07] (Euthanasia44) You might not want to believe she really wants to do it
<BR>[19:08] (Euthanasia44) Because you like her
<BR>[19:08] (stbdchick) liking her isn't the relevant bit
<BR>[19:09] (Euthanasia44) but it is effecting your judgement I think
<BR>[19:09] (Euthanasia44) because it always does when you really like someone
<BR>[19:09] (stbdchick) I have heard her say too many conflicting things
<BR>[19:09] (Euthanasia44) like?
<BR>[19:10] (stbdchick) like that she doesn't really want to die
<BR>[19:11] (Euthanasia44) Oh? when did she say that?
<BR>[19:11] (stbdchick) in posts
<BR>[19:11] (stbdchick) and once in chat with me
<BR>[19:11] (Euthanasia44) I saw that too
<BR>[19:11] (Euthanasia44) she told me not to take that seriously
<BR>[19:11] (Euthanasia44) hmmmmm
<BR>[19:12] (Euthanasia44) Well, if she does not want to die, she wont go through with this
<BR>[19:12] (stbdchick) we'll see
<BR>[19:12] (Euthanasia44) She seems pretty sure of this to me.
<BR>[19:13] (Euthanasia44) I told her I would not be angry if she backed out, and I would not be
<BR>[19:14] (stbdchick) like I said, I will talk to her some more
<BR>[19:14] (Euthanasia44) there she is
<BR>[19:15] (stbdchick) yes
<BR>[19:16] (Euthanasia44) husband is home
<BR>[19:16] (Euthanasia44) but is leaving, hope she calls me
<BR>[19:19] (Euthanasia44) it can be so hard to get a dinner date sometimes
<BR>[19:19] (stbdchick) that was BAD!
<BR>[19:19] (Euthanasia44) what happend to your humor today
<BR>Session Close: Fri Dec 15 20:15:59 2000
<P>
Session Start: Fri Dec 15 21:02:49 2000
<BR>[21:02] (stbdchick) do not ban <I>(nick1 deleted)</I> from here please
<BR>[21:03] (stbdchick) it's where he hangs when he's banned from the real channel
<BR>[21:03] (Euthanasia44) your a mind reader ha?
<BR>[21:03] (stbdchick) couldn't think of any other reaosn you'd be in this one
<BR>[21:03] (stbdchick) he really is an ok kid, he just has manic phases
<BR>[21:03] (Euthanasia44) your right, 
<BR>[21:04] (stbdchick) and he gets obnoxious then
<BR>[21:04] (Euthanasia44) yes
<BR>[21:04] (Euthanasia44) I understand
<BR>[21:04] (Euthanasia44) I was not going to ban him, even from the otoher channell
<BR>[21:04] (stbdchick) then?
<BR>[21:05] (Euthanasia44) He does suffer with an illness, and I guess we should try to be more understanding
<BR>[21:05] (Euthanasia44) but wasn curious as what he was doing here
<BR>[21:05] (Euthanasia44) was
<BR>[21:05] (stbdchick) we ban him when he's being disruptive, but let him back in a day or two
<BR>[21:05] (Euthanasia44) Ok
<BR>[21:06] (Euthanasia44) your right about people who have problems, sometimes they are a pain in the ass
<BR>[21:06] (stbdchick) I know... sometimes I feel as if starting the channel made me the babysitter
<BR>[21:06] (Euthanasia44) I will leave now and not get into anything with him
<BR>[21:07] (Euthanasia44) it has
<BR>[21:07] (Euthanasia44) you are the babysister
<BR>[21:07] (Euthanasia44) baby sitter that is, hahha
<BR>[21:07] (Euthanasia44) but you reallty care about these people
<BR>[21:07] (Euthanasia44) can't type
<BR>[21:07] (stbdchick) course I care
<BR>[21:08] (Euthanasia44) You really want to leave them?
<BR>[21:08] (Euthanasia44) you really started something special here with this channel
<BR>[21:08] (stbdchick) I have to go back to work, so am mostly gonna leave them anyways
<BR>[21:09] (Euthanasia44) different values then any other channel on IRC, and it has worked very well
<BR>[21:10] (Euthanasia44) So you should feel good about the channel
<BR>[21:10] (stbdchick) the channel has gone well, yes
<BR>[21:10] (stbdchick) SOPs will keep it going
<BR>[21:10] (Euthanasia44) You want to talk <I>(nick2 deleted)</I> out of it, I want to talk you out of it, sheses
<BR>[21:11] (stbdchick) and I'll give the password to a couple folks
<BR>[21:11] (Euthanasia44) yes we will
<BR>[21:11] (Euthanasia44) but they are not you
<BR>[21:12] (stbdchick) heh... if everyone talks everyone out of it... you'll be hungry in the cabin in february!
<BR>[21:12] (Euthanasia44) hahahahaha
<BR>[21:13] (Euthanasia44) no, just we would have to order a pizza
<BR>[21:13] (stbdchick) heh
<BR>[21:14] (Euthanasia44) but you and her would have a lot of explaining to do when you got to your homes
<BR>[21:14] (Euthanasia44) she would have it worse
<BR>[21:14] (Euthanasia44) sould be sure before coming
<BR>[21:14] (Euthanasia44) Backing out would not be nice at that point
<BR>[21:16] (stbdchick) I agree
<BR>[21:16] (Euthanasia44) the news is talking about the woman that jumped out of the plane in flight
<BR>[21:17] (Euthanasia44) maybe she wanted to smoke
<BR>[21:18] (stbdchick) lol!

<BR>[22:28] Session Ident: Euthanasia44 <I>(IP deleted)</I>
<BR>[22:28] (Euthanasia44) www.incore.com/india/wildlife.tiger.html
<BR>[22:29] (stbdchick) yopu just wanna make sure SOMEONE gets to eat me
<BR>[22:29] (Euthanasia44) hahahahaha
<BR>[22:29] (stbdchick) ;)
<BR>[22:29] (Euthanasia44) that will tell you how the tiger attacks and feeds, hahhaha
<BR>[22:29] (Euthanasia44) But I found out the rate of attacks in the last few years
<BR>[22:30] (Euthanasia44) It has gone from 49 deaths to only 14 in 99
<BR>[22:33] (stbdchick) seems a long shot
<BR>[22:33] (Euthanasia44) but what you said about cats does not apply to a tiger
<BR>[22:33] (stbdchick) i see that
<BR>[22:34] (Euthanasia44) You could make more sure by taking a jog through its area at dusk
<BR>[22:34] (Euthanasia44) I thought they would knock you out or kill you quickly
<BR>[22:34] (Euthanasia44) You would never know it happend
<BR>[22:35] (Euthanasia44) You would have to find out the areas that have the most man eaters, and there are such areas
<BR>[22:36] (stbdchick) U don' think that'd be sure
<BR>[22:36] (stbdchick) if it had eaten earlier that day
<BR>[22:37] (Euthanasia44) it wont attack you if it had
<BR>[22:37] (Euthanasia44) you want a hungry tiger hunting at dusk
<BR>[22:37] (Euthanasia44) you have to follow the game trails
<BR>[22:38] (Euthanasia44) that is where it will hunt
<BR>[22:38] (Euthanasia44) go on a tour first, and find the game trails
<BR>[22:38] (stbdchick) Euth, this is ridiculous, I've never been out of the country
<BR>[22:38] (stbdchick) have no diea what game trails would look like
<BR>[22:38] (stbdchick) nor how to find a hungry tiger
<BR>[22:38] (Euthanasia44) Well, it was an idea
<BR>[22:39] (Euthanasia44) and no probl with the insurance
<BR>[22:40] (Euthanasia44) but it is harder now then it was a few years ago because of how they have hunted them out of there rightful place
<BR>[22:40] (Euthanasia44) the tiger would find you
<BR>[22:41] (Euthanasia44) but guess I better work on another idea, hahhah
<BR>[22:41] (Euthanasia44) but I wanted yu to see that page anyway
<BR>[22:42] (stbdchick) thanks
<BR>[22:43] (Euthanasia44) you probably will wind up on my dinner table after all, but want you to have all the options
<BR>[22:43] (stbdchick) well, you will cook me first, wouldn't want some poor tiger getting food poisoning
<BR>[22:45] (Euthanasia44) hahahha
<BR>[22:45] (Euthanasia44) So good of you to be conserned about wildlife, hahahaha
<BR>[22:46] (Euthanasia44) I'm going to be eating 6 legs, 6 tits, 6 thighs and 3 rumps, hmmmmmmmm
<BR>[22:47] (Euthanasia44) You would think I'm a starved tiger
<BR>[22:47] (stbdchick) heh
<BR>[22:49] (Euthanasia44) So do you want another choice from being eaten by me? or is this your choice?
<BR>[22:49] (stbdchick) I think so, yes
<BR>[22:50] (Euthanasia44) wich choice?
<BR>[22:50] (Euthanasia44) I gave you 2 options
<BR>[22:50] (stbdchick) I think I'm going with you
<BR>[22:50] (stbdchick) not for the eating part, which is irrelevant
<BR>[22:50] (Euthanasia44) Ok, your on the menu then
<BR>[22:51] (stbdchick) but just cause I don't wanna back out again and don't think I can go through it alone
<BR>[22:51] (Euthanasia44) yes
<BR>[22:51] (Euthanasia44) I understand that
<BR>[22:52] (Euthanasia44) if you did go for India, you would be a long ways from home and anyone you know
<BR>[22:52] (Euthanasia44) very lonely
<BR>[22:53] (stbdchick) true
<BR>[22:53] (Euthanasia44) not sure how much control you have over this, but need to ask you something
<BR>[22:54] (Euthanasia44) Could you switch to a vegetarian diet
<BR>[22:55] (stbdchick) ha!
<BR>[22:55] (stbdchick) could YOU?
<BR>[22:55] * stbdchick giggles.
<BR>[22:55] (Euthanasia44) nope
<BR>[22:55] (Euthanasia44) Oh well
<BR>[22:56] (Euthanasia44) unlike the tiger, I do play with my food, hahahahhaha
<BR>[22:56] (stbdchick) why switch my diet?
<BR>[22:57] (Euthanasia44) I understand the meat is better, but can't be sure.
<BR>[22:57] (Euthanasia44) and if possible, lose a little weight
<BR>[22:58] (Euthanasia44) I could not lift you by myself
<BR>[22:58] (Euthanasia44) But I might have a salution to that
<BR>[22:59] (Euthanasia44) I think I would have you get in the bath tub and then drink the wine that has the drug, then I don't have to move you anywhere
<BR>[22:59] (Euthanasia44) All the little things I have to consider
<BR>[22:59] (stbdchick) how are you going to make SURE I am dead before you start carving on me?
<BR>[22:59] (Euthanasia44) I know, you don't like to hear the details
<BR>[23:00] (Euthanasia44) you will be under water for a long time without boobles
<BR>[23:00] (Euthanasia44) and
<BR>[23:01] (Euthanasia44) after I believe your dead, I will cut your throat tring at the same time to remove your head
<BR>[23:01] (Euthanasia44) have to drain the blood next
<BR>[23:01] (Euthanasia44) You will be dead
<BR>[23:02] (Euthanasia44) the blood will be washed down the drain
<BR>[23:02] (Euthanasia44) then your ready for carving
<BR>[23:03] (stbdchick) I don't think I need this much detail
<BR>[23:03] (Euthanasia44) well, you ask?
<BR>[23:03] (Euthanasia44) Did you talk more with <I>(nick2 deleted)</I>?
<BR>[23:04] (stbdchick) not much
<BR>[23:05] (Euthanasia44) So do you think about this alot?
<BR>[23:07] (stbdchick) about death?  yes
<BR>[23:07] (Euthanasia44) that and how we are going to do it? and maybe other options you might think of
<BR>[23:08] (stbdchick) I haven't had much time to think on my own yet
<BR>[23:08] (stbdchick) you're always here when I'm online!  ;)
<BR>[23:08] (Euthanasia44) because you spend so much time on others problems
<BR>[23:09] (stbdchick) true
<BR>[23:09] (Euthanasia44) are you trying to tell me something? like leave you be for a wile?
<BR>[23:10] (stbdchick) it might be good to give me a few days to "digest" all this
<BR>[23:10] (stbdchick) it's been a lot
<BR>[23:10] (Euthanasia44) ok
<BR>[23:10] (stbdchick) and I need to talk to <I>(nick2 deleted)</I> a bit more too
<BR>[23:10] (Euthanasia44) well do
<BR>[23:11] (Euthanasia44) Yep
<BR>[23:11] (Euthanasia44) but think she wants this
<BR>[23:12] (stbdchick) I just need to feel more comfortable about that
<BR>[23:12] (Euthanasia44) You know who I'm worried about? <I>(nick3 deleted)</I>
<BR>[23:13] (Euthanasia44) I have become close to her
<BR>[23:13] (Euthanasia44) I hope she is ok
<BR>[23:14] (stbdchick) I haven't seen <I>(nick3 deleted)</I> online hardly at all
<BR>[23:14] (Euthanasia44) I know
<BR>[23:14] (stbdchick) she may have been hospitalized
<BR>[23:15] (Euthanasia44) not sure
<BR>[23:15] (Euthanasia44) but I'm worried about her
<BR>[23:15] (Euthanasia44) Hope I get a chanc to talk to her soon
<BR>[23:16] (Euthanasia44) Oh well, I will go now for a few days

<BR>[13:39] (Euthanasia44) Hey, why does <I>(nick1 deleted)</I> have opp's, you know how dangerous that can be.
<BR>[13:40] (stbdchick) I didn't op him
<BR>[13:40] (stbdchick) but I don't un-op someone unless they do something wrong
<BR>[13:40] (Euthanasia44) I see
<BR>[13:40] (Euthanasia44) hmmmm
<BR>[13:40] (Euthanasia44) Well
<BR>[13:40] (Euthanasia44) He is quite now
<BR>[13:40] (Euthanasia44) so, guess I will leave him alone
<BR>[13:41] (Euthanasia44) but don';t think he should be opped
<BR>[13:41] (stbdchick) like I said, I didn't op him
<BR>[13:42] (Euthanasia44) I know
<BR>[13:42] (stbdchick) but... when I give people op's, I don't wanna tell them what to do
<BR>[13:42] (stbdchick) so... someone opped him
<BR>[13:42] (Euthanasia44) there is a way I think of setting his leval so no one can op him.
<BR>[13:42] (Euthanasia44) But, wont worry about it now

<BR>[19:40] (stbdchick) have you spoken to <I>(nick2 deleted)</I> lately?
<BR>[19:40] (Euthanasia44) Not today
<BR>[19:40] (Euthanasia44) yesturday for a few
<BR>[19:41] (Euthanasia44) was wondering where she is today
<BR>[19:41] (stbdchick) I spoke to her from work today
<BR>[19:41] (stbdchick) but had to leave to see my therapist
<BR>[19:41] (Euthanasia44) and?
<BR>[19:41] (stbdchick) and now there is no answer
<BR>[19:41] (Euthanasia44) well, how was she doing when you did talk to her?
<BR>[19:41] (stbdchick) not good
<BR>[19:42] (stbdchick) she was pretty damned down
<BR>[19:42] (Euthanasia44) she has kids and lots of things going on there
<BR>[19:42] (stbdchick) kids got out of school early today - they were already there
<BR>[19:42] (stbdchick) I'll try back in a little while
<BR>[19:50] (Euthanasia44) well?
<BR>[19:50] (stbdchick) I was just knocked off, didn't try yet
<BR>[19:51] (Euthanasia44) she might be picking up her kids
<BR>[19:51] (Euthanasia44) or doing something with them
<BR>[19:51] (Euthanasia44) she is 5 hours behind you
<BR>[19:51] (stbdchick) I know
<BR>[19:52] (Euthanasia44) So, would not panic yet
<BR>[19:52] (stbdchick) I'm not panicking, just checking
<BR>[19:52] (Euthanasia44) I sure don't want her to go splat for sure
<BR>[19:52] (Euthanasia44) Ok
<BR>[19:52] (Euthanasia44) I know you feel close to her
<BR>[19:53] (Euthanasia44) I saw your post to her today on ASH
<BR>[19:53] (stbdchick) that was a few days ago
<BR>[19:54] (Euthanasia44) would you call the police?
<BR>[19:55] (stbdchick) not unless she wanted me to
<BR>[19:55] (Euthanasia44) The word police makes me very uncomfortable as you would understnad
<BR>[19:55] (stbdchick) people have the right to decide
<BR>[19:55] (stbdchick) yes
<BR>[19:56] (Euthanasia44) I know it's hard when you get close to someone
<BR>[19:56] (Euthanasia44) I'm very worried now about <I>(nick3 deleted)</I>
<BR>[19:57] (Euthanasia44) I hope she is ok
<BR>[19:57] (stbdchick) <I>(nick3 deleted)</I> was in bad shape this morning when I spoke to her
<BR>[19:57] (Euthanasia44) Oh?
<BR>[19:58] (Euthanasia44) tell me what you know
<BR>[19:58] (stbdchick) yes
<BR>[19:58] (stbdchick) she was thinking of a soft hanging tonight
<BR>[19:58] (Euthanasia44) did she tell her dad? is that is waht is going on?
<BR>[19:59] (Euthanasia44) Well, it's morning there now
<BR>[19:59] (Euthanasia44) I have not ben able to catch her when she is on
<BR>[20:01] (Euthanasia44) Well, how did your second day at work go?
<BR>[20:01] (stbdchick) ok
<BR>[20:01] (stbdchick) we had a 3 hour party
<BR>[20:02] (stbdchick) so not much work
<BR>[20:02] (Euthanasia44) great
<BR>[20:03] (Euthanasia44) <I>(nick2 deleted)</I> sent me a picture of her, have not got it yet
<BR>[20:04] (Euthanasia44) I will scann it and send you a copy
<BR>[20:07] (stbdchick) cool
<BR>[20:07] (stbdchick) I haven't seen a picture yet
<BR>[20:07] (stbdchick) you mean she mailed it?
<BR>[20:07] (Euthanasia44) I have not talked to her on the phone, and really need too
<BR>[20:07] (Euthanasia44) yes
<BR>[20:07] (Euthanasia44) on the way
<BR>[20:08] (Euthanasia44) I talk to <I>(nick5 deleted)</I> everyday by phone, calling for free through the internet of corse
<BR>[20:08] (stbdchick) how is she doing?
<BR>[20:09] (Euthanasia44) She really wants to do this
<BR>[20:09] (stbdchick) does she know why you do?
<BR>[20:09] (Euthanasia44) she will have a couple of thousand dollars next week, so she will have no problem paying her air fair
<BR>[20:10] (Euthanasia44) She does not know about my reasons, and have not ask
<BR>[20:10] (stbdchick) how did she get $?  I thought she was young and lvied with her parents?
<BR>[20:10] (Euthanasia44) she does not care
<BR>[20:10] (Euthanasia44) When she worked, she had some kind of mutual fund
<BR>[20:11] (Euthanasia44) she can cash it in now
<BR>[20:11] (stbdchick) I guess saving for her retirement is irrelevant
<BR>[20:11] * stbdchick sighs.
<BR>[20:11] (Euthanasia44) yep, hahhaa
<BR>[20:11] (stbdchick) does she live near <I>(nick4 deleted)</I>?  Ottawa?
<BR>[20:11] (stbdchick) <-knows nothing about Canada except it's a big giant land mass up there
<BR>[20:12] (Euthanasia44) No, she is in the French part
<BR>[20:12] (stbdchick) quebec?
<BR>[20:12] (Euthanasia44) manatoba I think
<BR>[20:13] (Euthanasia44) No, Montrial
<BR>[20:13] (Euthanasia44) I can't be sure of <I>(nick2 deleted)</I> until I talk to her
<BR>[20:13] (stbdchick) Montreal is a big city, isn't it?
<BR>[20:13] (Euthanasia44) yep
<BR>[20:13] (stbdchick) I don't know if anyone can be sure of <I>(nick2 deleted)</I>
<BR>[20:14] (stbdchick) she seems flaky to me
<BR>[20:14] (stbdchick) unsure
<BR>[20:14] (stbdchick) so <I>(nick5 deleted)</I> knows you will be killing others?
<BR>[20:14] (Euthanasia44) this is what I'm worrid about
<BR>[20:14] (Euthanasia44) yes
<BR>[20:15] (Euthanasia44) She knows she is last
<BR>[20:15] (stbdchick) what does she know about you?
<BR>[20:15] (Euthanasia44) and will be staying there for a week before she is done
<BR>[20:15] (Euthanasia44) Well, we talked about the details of doing her, and about how we will spend the week until her turn
<BR>[20:16] (stbdchick) she going to be doing sexual stuff with you?
<BR>[20:16] (Euthanasia44) I think so
<BR>[20:16] (stbdchick) you discussed with her?
<BR>[20:16] (Euthanasia44) We were talking in that area today
<BR>[20:17] (Euthanasia44) I will be talking to her tomorrow
<BR>[20:17] (Euthanasia44) again
<BR>[20:17] (stbdchick) go slow... don't scare her off
<BR>[20:17] (Euthanasia44) I know that
<BR>[20:17] (Euthanasia44) and I am
<BR>[20:17] (stbdchick) I have kind of got used to... the idea of not being the only one
<BR>[20:17] (Euthanasia44) I think I scared you off, hahahaha
<BR>[20:17] (stbdchick) and <I>(nick2 deleted)</I> is... well, dunno about her
<BR>[20:18] (stbdchick) scared ME off?
<BR>[20:18] (Euthanasia44) I really wanted <I>(nick2 deleted)</I> a lot
<BR>[20:18] (Euthanasia44) I will be very disapointed if I don't get her
<BR>[20:19] (stbdchick) why her specifically?  she refused any sex, didn't she?
<BR>[20:19] (Euthanasia44) yep, but a great body
<BR>[20:19] (Euthanasia44) and lots of money to give me she wont need
<BR>[20:19] (Euthanasia44) I do need it
<BR>[20:20] (stbdchick) what for?  I thought the money was just to cover the cost of the cabin?
<BR>[20:20] (Euthanasia44) Well, I had ask her for that and whatever she can sell and come up with to give me as well
<BR>[20:20] (Euthanasia44) she wont need it
<BR>[20:21] (stbdchick) what do you need money for?
<BR>[20:21] (stbdchick) yeah, but she's got kids
<BR>[20:21] (Euthanasia44) a lot of things
<BR>[20:21] (stbdchick) like what?
<BR>[20:21] (Euthanasia44) Like getting married
<BR>[20:22] (Euthanasia44) don't ask
<BR>[20:22] (stbdchick) well, I'm concerned
<BR>[20:22] (stbdchick) I thought your motivaiton was purely sexual
<BR>[20:22] (Euthanasia44) But even so, the cabin and the meat grinder and all the expences
<BR>[20:23] (Euthanasia44) it is for sure, but money also motivates me to take the risk as well, so both
<BR>[20:23] (stbdchick) you didn't talk to me about money much
<BR>[20:24] (Euthanasia44) No, because she had enough for both of you
<BR>[20:24] (stbdchick) I never got the impression that money was a motivator for you before
<BR>[20:24] (stbdchick) I thought... I understood
<BR>[20:24] (stbdchick) now I'm kinda confused
<BR>[20:24] (Euthanasia44) I have to regroup if she is not going to be in this
<BR>[20:25] (stbdchick) how much does a meat grinder cost?
<BR>[20:25] (Euthanasia44) from what i'm looking at, $1,300.00 up
<BR>[20:25] (stbdchick) and the cabin?
<BR>[20:26] (Euthanasia44) if I get the right grinder, can just put the ground meat and bone down the garbage desposal
<BR>[20:26] (Euthanasia44) the cabin I showed you was 1500 per week
<BR>[20:27] (Euthanasia44) off season
<BR>[20:27] (Euthanasia44) So over 3 thousand
<BR>[20:27] (stbdchick) so... we're talking about $4500 in expenses total
<BR>[20:27] (Euthanasia44) over 4 that is
<BR>[20:27] (Euthanasia44) around that
<BR>[20:27] (stbdchick) cause you won't be buying groceries any
<BR>[20:28] (stbdchick) how much are you getting from <I>(nick5 deleted)</I>?
<BR>[20:28] (Euthanasia44) she has 2 grand, so what she does not spend on air, I get
<BR>[20:28] (Euthanasia44) 2 grand Canadian that is
<BR>[20:28] (Euthanasia44) about 15% less then our money
<BR>[20:29] (Euthanasia44) I might look for a cheeper cabin
<BR>[20:29] (Euthanasia44) that one is very nice, but expensive
<BR>[20:30] (Euthanasia44) but she has more then enough for air fair with money left over
<BR>[20:30] (stbdchick) how far is Montreal?  I mean... might not be more than $500 for airfare
<BR>[20:30] (Euthanasia44) it would probably not be more then that
<BR>[20:31] (stbdchick) which means at least $1500... which translates to about $1100-$1200
<BR>[20:31] (Euthanasia44) yes
<BR>[20:31] (stbdchick) that would cover the grinder
<BR>[20:31] (stbdchick) so we're talking another $3K for the cabin
<BR>[20:31] (Euthanasia44) well, I have to have that money before she comes, not after
<BR>[20:31] (stbdchick) cause I feel no real desire to help finance your wedding, no offense
<BR>[20:31] (Euthanasia44) and there is tax
<BR>[20:32] (Euthanasia44) Well, I'm going to still give <I>(nick2 deleted)</I> a chance here
<BR>[20:32] (Euthanasia44) rather you want me to have more then the expencises or not
<BR>[20:33] (Euthanasia44) I will need to pin her down however
<BR>[20:33] (stbdchick) well, I couldn't get that much out of my 401K via a hardship withdrawal
<BR>[20:33] (Euthanasia44) ok
<BR>[20:33] (stbdchick) but I could take a loan for any amount in the account
<BR>[20:33] (stbdchick) whish is $14,000
<BR>[20:33] (Euthanasia44) oh?
<BR>[20:34] (Euthanasia44) that would be nice
<BR>[20:34] (stbdchick) obviously, I wish to leave as much as possible to my daughter
<BR>[20:34] (Euthanasia44) yes
<BR>[20:34] (Euthanasia44) Well, she gets your insurance at some time
<BR>[20:35] (stbdchick) yes, but... whatever isn't absolutely necessary for costs is going to her
<BR>[20:35] (Euthanasia44) does she get your retirment if you turn up missing?
<BR>[20:35] (stbdchick) I care about her much more than your wedding, again, no offense
<BR>[20:35] (stbdchick) sure... she's beneficiary on all my accounts
<BR>[20:36] (stbdchick) it wouldn't really be abd if she didn't get it for a few years
<BR>[20:36] (stbdchick) cause she'd qualify for full financial aid as an orphan
<BR>[20:36] (Euthanasia44) But they can't release the money unless your dead, or assumed to be dead
<BR>[20:36] (stbdchick) which means the govt would pay for her education
<BR>[20:36] (stbdchick) so instead of my money paying for college, she'd get it afterwards... and still have the college
<BR>[20:37] (Euthanasia44) can you get unsecured loans?
<BR>[20:38] (stbdchick) no, I have bad credit
<BR>[20:38] (stbdchick) but I can borrow from my 401K
<BR>[20:39] (Euthanasia44) but you only want to go up to 4 K
<BR>[20:39] (stbdchick) I only want to go up to what we *need*
<BR>[20:39] (stbdchick) you are getting sex and a lot of dinners out of this, I'm not gonna pay you too
<BR>[20:40] (Euthanasia44) Yes, guess I am rather selfish
<BR>[20:41] (Euthanasia44) how much sex?
<BR>[20:41] (stbdchick) yeah, we never finished agreeing on that, did we?
<BR>[20:41] (Euthanasia44) no
<BR>[20:41] (stbdchick) I had originally agreed to one day
<BR>[20:41] (stbdchick) and you started asking for 3 or 4
<BR>[20:41] (Euthanasia44) thought we deed, but not sure
<BR>[20:41] (Euthanasia44) yes
<BR>[20:42] (stbdchick) if we assume <I>(nick2 deleted)</I> is out of the picture, I can be there first, right?
<BR>[20:42] (Euthanasia44) yep
<BR>[20:42] (Euthanasia44) and go first
<BR>[20:43] (stbdchick) so is <I>(nick5 deleted)</I> just ok with being there with corpses?  or is she ok with being there and meeting me and stuff?
<BR>[20:43] (Euthanasia44) she is fine with both
<BR>[20:44] (Euthanasia44) so, about how much sex?
<BR>[20:44] (stbdchick) we will see what happens with <I>(nick2 deleted)</I>, though she is very changeable and I'm not sure we can count on her
<BR>[20:44] (Euthanasia44) I know
<BR>[20:44] (stbdchick) Euth, it is kinda gonna depend on who is gonna be there and when and such
<BR>[20:44] (stbdchick) <I>(nick5 deleted)</I> into chicks at all?
<BR>[20:45] (Euthanasia44) Not sure

<BR>[20:45] (Euthanasia44) rather <I>(nick2 deleted)</I> does it or not
<BR>[20:45] (Euthanasia44) how much sex are you willing to give me?
<BR>[20:45] (stbdchick) <I>(nick2 deleted)</I> is completly opposed to sex at all
<BR>[20:45] (stbdchick) and I don't think she's into women at all
<BR>[20:45] (Euthanasia44) yep
<BR>[20:46] (stbdchick) some of the chicks in channel flirt back with me, she doesn't
<BR>[20:46] (Euthanasia44) I know
<BR>[20:46] (stbdchick) I told ya, Euth, it depends
<BR>[20:46] (Euthanasia44) I promised her I would not force her
<BR>[20:46] (Euthanasia44) and I wont

<BR>[20:47] (Euthanasia44) I want to know if you would serve me for 3 or 4 days?
<BR>[20:47] (Euthanasia44) I like women into women as well
<BR>[20:48] (stbdchick) in general, I have had no drive for almost a year now
<BR>[20:48] (stbdchick) and I have less drive with men in general
<BR>[20:48] (stbdchick) and would be inhibited by <I>(nick2 deleted)</I>'s presence

<P>
Session Start: Tue Dec 19 20:57:25 2000
<BR>[20:57] Session Ident: Euthanasia44 <I>(IP deleted)</I>
<BR>[20:57] (Euthanasia44) Hi, I'm back
<BR>[20:57] (stbdchick) re
<BR>[20:57] (stbdchick) you ate fast
<BR>[20:58] (Euthanasia44) yep, was not a body of a woman,hahaha
<BR>[20:58] (Euthanasia44) Now back to business
<BR>[20:58] (stbdchick) faster when ya don't have to hunt, kill, butcher...
<BR>[20:58] (Euthanasia44) there would be food expencises
<BR>[20:59] (Euthanasia44) she will need to eat for 1 week, and I have promissed her some good stong German beer
<BR>[20:59] (Euthanasia44) and have the cost of the drug as well, and getting a hold of it
<BR>[21:00] (stbdchick) d00d, you'd be buying groceries for yourself at home anyways, thta's not an extra cost
<BR>[21:00] (Euthanasia44) I do know that you and <I>(nick5 deleted)</I> will go through with it for sure
<BR>[21:00] (stbdchick) which drug are we talking here?
<BR>[21:00] (Euthanasia44) the drug is called GHB, common date rape drug
<BR>[21:01] (Euthanasia44) GBL would work as well, it becomes GHB in the body after consumed
<BR>[21:01] (stbdchick) I thought that was cheap and easily available... only some states have banned it so far...
<BR>[21:01] (stbdchick) what is gbl?
<BR>[21:01] (stbdchick) I will have to reserach this a bit
<BR>[21:01] (Euthanasia44) go ahead, congress made GHB very illegal
<BR>[21:02] (Euthanasia44) Hve to get it out of the U.S.
<BR>[21:02] (Euthanasia44) You used to be albe to buy GBL as a cleaner to get away with it
<BR>[21:03] (Euthanasia44) you will find lots about GHB on the internet
<BR>[21:04] (stbdchick) I will have to look into it a bit and see what I can find
<BR>[21:04] (Euthanasia44) it is a nice rec drug too, but when mixed with a drink, and in over does
<BR>[21:04] (stbdchick) meanwhile, I am "faking" it up in channel a bit here...
<BR>[21:04] (stbdchick) I cna't spend ALL my time chatting with you or they'll get suspicious
<BR>[21:04] (stbdchick) but I'm here
<BR>[21:05] (Euthanasia44) you can leave the channel and change your nick
<BR>[21:05] (Euthanasia44) I'm not in any channel now
<BR>[21:05] (Euthanasia44) Oh wait
<BR>[21:05] (Euthanasia44) I am
<BR>[21:05] (Euthanasia44) hahha
<BR>[21:05] (Euthanasia44) Now I'm not
<BR>[21:06] (Euthanasia44) how about letting me call you?
<BR>[21:06] (stbdchick) I'm not sure I wanna give you my phone number yet
<BR>[21:07] (stbdchick) I have a kid, you know
<BR>[21:07] (stbdchick) why don't I call you?
<BR>[21:07] (Euthanasia44) I'm not going to eat her up
<BR>[21:07] (stbdchick) could call on my lunch break tomorrow
<BR>[21:07] (Euthanasia44) or say anything to her
<BR>[21:07] (Euthanasia44) why don't you just trust me
<BR>[21:08] (Euthanasia44) I would never say anything to your daughter
<BR>[21:08] (Euthanasia44) I can call you free through the internet
<BR>[21:09] (Euthanasia44) and only when you say it is ok
<BR>[21:09] (stbdchick) yeah, but you have no risk if I call you
<BR>[21:09] (Euthanasia44) yes i do
<BR>[21:09] (stbdchick) whereas I have huge risk if I trust you first and I'm wrong
<BR>[21:09] (Euthanasia44) your call is a record
<BR>[21:09] (stbdchick) you do not have a child
<BR>[21:09] (stbdchick) there is no risk compared to that
<BR>[21:09] (stbdchick) no record
<BR>[21:09] (stbdchick) on my lunch break, from a payphone, using a prepaid calling card
<BR>[21:10] (Euthanasia44) you don't trust me at all, yet you are going to let me kill you?
<BR>[21:10] (Euthanasia44) Ok
<BR>[21:10] (Euthanasia44) but after that, you have to trust me too
<BR>[21:10] (stbdchick) we'll see how the call goes
<BR>[21:11] (stbdchick) if I feel ok after talking to you, then I will
<BR>[21:11] (Euthanasia44) 12 noon?
<BR>[21:11] (stbdchick) 1 my time
<BR>[21:11] (stbdchick) which would be ten your time
<BR>[21:11] (Euthanasia44) I honestly would do nothing to your daughter
<BR>[21:11] (stbdchick) if anything comes up and I can't, I'll email you from my hotmail account
<BR>[21:11] (Euthanasia44) but I will give you my number
<BR>[21:12] (Euthanasia44) 1 your time would be 10 am my time
<BR>[21:12] (Euthanasia44) where are you going to keep my number?
<BR>[21:12] (Euthanasia44) I don't want my number left anywhere 
<BR>[21:13] (stbdchick) on the back of the prepaid calling card
<BR>[21:13] (Euthanasia44) if you have a note book, you will have to bring it
<BR>[21:13] (stbdchick) so when the card is used up, it'll be discarded
<BR>[21:13] (Euthanasia44) Ok
<BR>[21:13] (Euthanasia44) ok
<BR>[21:13] (Euthanasia44) <I>(phone number deleted)</I>
<BR>[21:13] (stbdchick) ok, got it
<BR>[21:14] (Euthanasia44) I only call <I>(nick5 deleted)</I> when it is ok
<BR>[21:14] (Euthanasia44) I would do the same with you
<BR>[21:14] (Euthanasia44) I'm not really that bad
<BR>[21:15] (stbdchick) well, I wanna reassure myself of that
<BR>[21:15] (stbdchick) easier to fake online, harder voice
<BR>[21:15] (Euthanasia44) but I'm thinking I better get this setup or we will lose the chance
<BR>[21:16] (Euthanasia44) I wanted to talk to <I>(nick2 deleted)</I> first
<BR>[21:16] (Euthanasia44) I'm very very sure of <I>(nick5 deleted)</I>
<BR>[21:16] (stbdchick) she sounds stable
<BR>[21:17] (stbdchick) I am interested to know more about her
<BR>[21:17] (Euthanasia44) But she does not want to wait longer then she hs too
<BR>[21:17] (Euthanasia44) stable?
<BR>[21:17] (Euthanasia44) she wanted to stab herself in the tummy
<BR>[21:17] (Euthanasia44) but she is stable in the way of being very sure and commited to doing this with me
<BR>[21:17] (stbdchick) well, she hasn't been changing her mind tho
<BR>[21:18] (Euthanasia44) Oh no
<BR>[21:18] (Euthanasia44) I have tried to give her all the reasons to not do it
<BR>[21:18] (Euthanasia44) but she is sure this is the only way for her
<BR>[21:18] (Euthanasia44) she is a dead chick rather i help her or not, adn if i don't help her, she wil suffer a lot
<BR>[21:19] (Euthanasia44) She is what i feel would be conserdered learning disabled
<BR>[21:20] (stbdchick) how so?
<BR>[21:20] (Euthanasia44) She hs no motivation
<BR>[21:20] (Euthanasia44) she is not real smart
<BR>[21:20] (Euthanasia44) why she hs never thought to ask me why I'm doing this
<BR>[21:20] (stbdchick) not smart or actually slow?
<BR>[21:20] (Euthanasia44) probably more not smart
<BR>[21:21] (Euthanasia44) but we do have a language problem sometimes as well
<BR>[21:21] (Euthanasia44) but she does ok with english
<BR>[21:24] (stbdchick) that may be the problem rather than intelligence
<BR>[21:24] (stbdchick) what did she do when she worked?
<BR>[21:24] (Euthanasia44) not sure
<BR>[21:24] (Euthanasia44) forgot
<BR>[21:26] (Euthanasia44) you were saying about your not being into men?
<BR>[21:29] (stbdchick) not very much
<BR>[21:29] (stbdchick) sometimes, if I feel clsoe to one
<BR>[21:29] (Euthanasia44) hmmmmmm
<BR>[21:31] (Euthanasia44) you would be the happest if I killed you the day you got there ha?
<BR>[21:31] (Euthanasia44) <I>(nick2 deleted)</I> wanted to be done right away
<BR>[21:32] (stbdchick) depends
<BR>[21:33] (stbdchick) on if <I>(nick5 deleted)</I> is bi or bi-ish
<BR>[21:33] (Euthanasia44) not sure that she has had much sexual experinces
<BR>[21:34] (Euthanasia44) I'm trying to get that info of corse without being to obvious
<BR>[21:35] (stbdchick) hmmm....
<BR>[21:35] (stbdchick) maybe it'd be easier for her to talk to a woman...
<BR>[21:35] (Euthanasia44) hahahah
<BR>[21:36] (Euthanasia44) I'm doing just fin with her
<BR>[21:36] (Euthanasia44) she likes talking to me
<BR>[21:36] (Euthanasia44) We were talking about massage today
<BR>[21:37] (stbdchick) she likes giving massage?  receiving?
<BR>[21:37] (Euthanasia44) it was getting interesting
<BR>[21:37] (Euthanasia44) I was talking about my giving her a massage
<BR>[21:38] (Euthanasia44) and she wants me too
<BR>[21:38] (stbdchick) hmmm... that's a nice innocent way to start
<BR>[21:38] (Euthanasia44) yep
<BR>[21:38] (stbdchick) ask her how she'd feel about a woman giving her a massage
<BR>[21:38] (Euthanasia44) Ok
<BR>[21:38] (Euthanasia44) maybe she wants both, hahha
<BR>[21:39] (stbdchick) ;)
<BR>[21:39] (Euthanasia44) I will call her at 9 am my time so I will be done by 10 am for you to call
<BR>[21:40] (Euthanasia44) are you going to try again for <I>(nick2 deleted)</I>?
<BR>[21:41] (stbdchick) maybe tomorrow
<BR>[21:41] (stbdchick) I'm getting tired
<BR>[21:41] (stbdchick) this work shit sucks
<BR>[21:41] (Euthanasia44) I see
<BR>[21:42] (Euthanasia44) Well, I'm thinking of all the options
<BR>[21:43] (Euthanasia44) with women, are you the giver, or reciever?
<BR>[21:44] (stbdchick) giver
<BR>[21:44] (stbdchick) absolutely
<BR>[21:45] (Euthanasia44) you don't mind if I'm there too do ya? hahhaha
<BR>[21:45] (Euthanasia44) I have ben with 2 bi women before
<BR>[21:45] (stbdchick) no problem
<BR>[21:46] (Euthanasia44) I think with this being the last week of her life, she might be very open to it
<BR>[21:47] (Euthanasia44) she wanted to try LSD, but I do not know where to get it, and don't want her to freak out either, so she said it ws ok
<BR>[21:47] (Euthanasia44) I used to drop acid when iwas in my teens
<BR>[21:47] (Euthanasia44) but that was a  very long time ago
<BR>[21:48] (stbdchick) I haven't done acid
<BR>[21:48] (Euthanasia44) the drug GHBwhen not over dosed, is a great sex stimulent for women
<BR>[21:49] (Euthanasia44) to risky
<BR>[21:49] (Euthanasia44) don't want any freaking out on me
<BR>[21:49] (Euthanasia44) GHB has some good things to it
<BR>[21:49] (stbdchick) I dunno much about it
<BR>[21:50] (Euthanasia44) besides knocking someone out so can't be awakend
<BR>[21:51] (Euthanasia44) if she is into BI with you, how many days do you want? and of corse you would be serving me as well.
<BR>[21:52] (stbdchick) 4 or 5
<BR>[21:52] (Euthanasia44) She is 5-7 120 lbs with small breasts
<BR>[21:54] (stbdchick) drat
<BR>[21:54] (stbdchick) <-loves big tits
<BR>[21:54] (Euthanasia44) hahahah
<BR>[21:54] (Euthanasia44) <I>(nick2 deleted)</I> has small ones too
<BR>[21:54] (Euthanasia44) but small is firm and better for rosting i think
<BR>[21:55] (Euthanasia44) we will see
<BR>[21:56] (Euthanasia44) I will be eating your breasts first
<BR>[21:56] (stbdchick) I don't think they would be good
<BR>[21:56] (stbdchick) it's all fat and a few glands
<BR>[21:56] (Euthanasia44) maybe
<BR>[21:57] (Euthanasia44) the legs are the most important to me for eating
<BR>[21:57] (Euthanasia44) but will try the breasts
<BR>[21:57] (Euthanasia44) I should start making a list of things I need to do this
<BR>[21:58] (Euthanasia44) then we can see how much it will cost
<BR>[21:58] (Euthanasia44) I had writen to a few companies about the grinders, and only 1 wrote back to just ask me a bunch of questions
<BR>[21:59] (Euthanasia44) I would butcher you on the fourth day I think
<BR>[22:00] (Euthanasia44) I would butcher you on the fourth day even if <I>(nick2 deleted)</I> was there because she would have ben done the first day
<BR>[22:00] (stbdchick) questions about what?
<BR>[22:00] (Euthanasia44) what size meat and bone and condition o the bone and so on and so on
<BR>[22:01] (Euthanasia44) I will have to all
<BR>[22:01] (Euthanasia44) call
<BR>[22:01] (Euthanasia44) I have to be sure it will do what I need
<BR>[22:03] (Euthanasia44) If she is sexual with you, that will make you be more sexual with me?
<BR>[22:04] (stbdchick) oh yeah
<BR>[22:04] (stbdchick) chicks inspire me to great levels of horniness
<BR>[22:04] (stbdchick) ;)
