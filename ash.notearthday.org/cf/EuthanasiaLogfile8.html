<BR>[13:59] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia)maybe we should bring her in here too to discuss all this?
<BR>[13:59] (Euthanasia44) she is not on

<BR>[14:05] (stbdchick) but why is she suicidal?

<BR>[14:06] (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia)ok guys im gonna go for alike a while, ill be back later.  peace.
<BR>[14:06] *** (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) has left #cabinonthelake
<BR>[14:06] (Euthanasia44) no job, no BF, nothing in her life
<BR>[14:06] (Euthanasia44) no school
<BR>[14:06] (stbdchick) what does she do?
<BR>[14:06] (Euthanasia44) nothing
<BR>[14:06] (stbdchick) she doesn't work?
<BR>[14:06] (Euthanasia44) she lives with parents
<BR>[14:07] (Euthanasia44) she vegetates
<BR>[14:07] (Euthanasia44) sleeps
<BR>[14:07] (stbdchick) have you tried to talk her out of it?
<BR>[14:08] (Euthanasia44) no
<BR>[14:08] (Euthanasia44) but have questioned her abou it
<BR>[14:08] (stbdchick) why not?  you've tried to talk me out of it
<BR>[14:08] (Euthanasia44) and tried to give her options
<BR>[14:08] (Euthanasia44) To be sure this is what she wants
<BR>[14:09] (Euthanasia44) I will continue to do that until we get together
<BR>[14:09] (Euthanasia44) so if she changes her mind
<BR>[14:09] (stbdchick) why do you need 3 of us?
<BR>[14:09] (Euthanasia44) why not?
<BR>[14:09] (Euthanasia44) but is true
<BR>[14:09] (Euthanasia44) it is easier with just 1
<BR>[14:10] (Euthanasia44) but if I don't do all of you
<BR>[14:10] (stbdchick) why not?  cause you can't eat 3 people that fast anyway
<BR>[14:10] (Euthanasia44) I have the place, might as well help all three
<BR>[14:10] (Euthanasia44) No I can't
<BR>[14:10] (Euthanasia44) I will have to pick the best parts I desire eating
<BR>[14:11] (Euthanasia44) from the three of you
<BR>[14:11] (stbdchick) what's the url of the cabin?
<BR>[14:11] (stbdchick) also, did you find the story?  or the cannibal's anonymous link?
<BR>[14:12] (Euthanasia44) http://malonestahoecabin.com
<BR>[14:12] (Euthanasia44) No could not find it either
<BR>[14:12] (Euthanasia44) I think after you thought about it, you would rather be eaten by me then a tiger ha?
<BR>[14:13] (stbdchick) no, cats play with their food while killing it
<BR>[14:13] (stbdchick) I'd rather be fully dead before being eaten
<BR>[14:13] (Euthanasia44) yes of corse
<BR>[14:14] (stbdchick) so you decided on the cabin instead of the house?
<BR>[14:14] (Euthanasia44) well then, looks like your my food too
<BR>[14:14] (Euthanasia44) I think so, but still need to email for more info, but looks like it
<BR>[14:14] (Euthanasia44) it is easier for everyone to get too
<BR>[14:15] (stbdchick) how soon can we get it?
<BR>[14:15] (Euthanasia44) would you be ok being in the house with her meat in the fredg?
<BR>[14:15] (Euthanasia44) I have an email from him about dates
<BR>[14:16] (stbdchick) I definetly don't wanna be there when you kill her
<BR>[14:16] (stbdchick) and I don't need to see anything
<BR>[14:16] (stbdchick) I have to think about it, but... I think I can probably handle knowing her corpse is there as long as I don't have to see it
<BR>[14:16] (Euthanasia44) you can go to the casinos or something while I kill her
<BR>[14:16] (Euthanasia44) you wont
<BR>[14:17] (Euthanasia44) there are 5 bathrooms
<BR>[14:17] (Euthanasia44) will do this in one that you will never go into to
<BR>[14:17] (stbdchick) ok
<BR>[14:17] (Euthanasia44) I know you want to meet her
<BR>[14:18] (Euthanasia44) and think that is good
<BR>[14:18] (stbdchick) and I expect I'll be on a pretty strict vegetarian diet once I leave here
<BR>[14:18] (stbdchick) heh
<BR>[14:18] *** Retrieving #cabinonthelake info...
<BR>[14:18] (Euthanasia44) But I have to do what I have to do
<BR>[14:18] (Euthanasia44) yes
<BR>[14:18] (stbdchick) this cabin is gorgeous
<BR>[14:18] (Euthanasia44) you will get lots of protine from my cum too, hahahaha
<BR>[14:19] (Euthanasia44) yes it is
<BR>[14:19] (Euthanasia44) it is a beautiful place to go out with ha?
<BR>[14:20] (stbdchick) yes
<BR>[14:20] (stbdchick) pages laod slowly
<BR>[14:21] (Euthanasia44) yes
<BR>[14:22] (Euthanasia44) you understand as well, I can't say anthing to anyone on the channel about you catching the bus
<BR>[14:22] (stbdchick) so how long have you been talking to <I>(nick deleted)</I>?
<BR>[14:22] (stbdchick) yes, I know
<BR>[14:22] (Euthanasia44) I have to wonder with them on why you have not ben on
<BR>[14:22] (stbdchick) disappearing is... disappearing
<BR>[14:22] (Euthanasia44) yep
<BR>[14:23] (Euthanasia44) I told (WomanBesidesMeWhoWentAfterEuthanasia) to bring her lap top she uses
<BR>[14:23] (stbdchick) why?
<BR>[14:23] (Euthanasia44) I want to be sure I have everything that is on that computer whiped out, and it will allow me to be online at the time we do this
<BR>[14:24] (Euthanasia44) the police can recover deleted info
<BR>[14:24] (stbdchick) depends on how it's deleted
<BR>[14:24] (Euthanasia44) she has my phone number on it, and the location of the cabin
<BR>[14:24] (Euthanasia44) I want that computer
<BR>[14:24] (stbdchick) if you wipe/write enough times - no one can get info off of it
<BR>[14:25] (stbdchick) there's programs that let you do that
<BR>[14:25] (Euthanasia44) well, I want the lap top anyway
<BR>[14:25] (Euthanasia44) you will have to whip your pc too
<BR>[14:26] (stbdchick) of course
<BR>[14:26] (Euthanasia44) all details have to be followed
<BR>[14:27] (stbdchick) I wiped it back in May
<BR>[14:27] (Euthanasia44) I wont let you down if you do this
<BR>[14:27] (stbdchick) pain in the ass, cause I lost all my email and such
<BR>[14:27] (Euthanasia44) I know how important it is to you 
<BR>[14:27] (stbdchick) why do you want to be online when we do this?
<BR>[14:28] (Euthanasia44) So it looks like I'm still at home instead of gone at the same time you disapear
<BR>[14:28] (Euthanasia44) I mean just to be online everyday as would be normal
<BR>[14:29] (stbdchick) oh
<BR>[14:29] (Euthanasia44) and pretend nothing has changed
<BR>[14:29] (stbdchick) I was wondering if you were gonna be posting confessions to cannibal's anonymous or something
<BR>[14:29] (Euthanasia44) hahahahaha
<BR>[14:30] (Euthanasia44) wich of the three of you has the best taste ha?
<BR>[14:30] (Euthanasia44) hahahaha
<BR>[14:30] (Euthanasia44) I don't think so
<BR>[14:30] (stbdchick) you could get recipe suggestions
<BR>[14:30] (stbdchick) heh
<BR>[14:31] (Euthanasia44) I could make a cannibal cooking video
<BR>[14:32] (Euthanasia44) not sure wich parts of you I will have time to eat
<BR>[14:32] (Euthanasia44) going to have lots of meat
<BR>[14:32] (stbdchick) yep
<BR>[14:33] (Euthanasia44) don't think you will ahve to go over 3 days of sucking me
<BR>[14:33] (stbdchick) I can't imagine how you can eat even one person in a week as you told me
<BR>[14:33] (stbdchick) seems like an awful lot
<BR>[14:33] (Euthanasia44) I will not be able to eat all the meat, just have to pick the parts I like best
<BR>[14:35] (stbdchick) this cabin is huge
<BR>[14:35] (Euthanasia44) yes
<BR>[14:35] (Euthanasia44) hey, if a tiger were to eat you, he would not want you to suck his penis for 3 days first, hahahahaha
<BR>[14:36] (stbdchick) heh
<BR>[14:36] (stbdchick) good point
<BR>[14:36] (Euthanasia44) but, think you will choose my dinner table anyway
