<BR>[17:35] (Euthanasia45) Hi, got cut by the server.
<BR>[17:35] (stbdchick) re
<BR>[17:36] (Euthanasia45) So how is your talk going with her? I have not msged her yet
<BR>[17:36] (stbdchick) she left to make a phone call
<BR>[17:36] (Euthanasia45) Oh she left
<BR>[17:36] (stbdchick) is gonna be back in a bit
<BR>[17:36] (Euthanasia45) maybe she is going to call me
<BR>[17:36] (stbdchick) I'm gonna try to talk her into voicing
<BR>[17:36] (stbdchick) she wants help
<BR>[17:36] (Euthanasia45) voicing?
<BR>[17:37] (stbdchick) talking on the phone
<BR>[17:37] (Euthanasia45) are you sure?
<BR>[17:37] (Euthanasia45) did not sound lie it to me, maybe I'm just to dence or something
<BR>[17:37] (stbdchick) yeah, I'm sure
<BR>[17:37] (stbdchick) well... I'll become sure when we talk
<BR>[17:37] (Euthanasia45) hmmmmmm
<BR>[17:38] (Euthanasia45) I told her is was fine for her to back out
<BR>[17:39] (Euthanasia45) I would not be angry with her at all
<BR>[17:39] (Euthanasia45) I'm in a spot
<BR>[17:39] (Euthanasia45) don't know what to do
<BR>[17:40] (Euthanasia45) maybe this was just a crazy idea anyway
<BR>[17:40] *** Euthanasia44 has left IRC

<P>Session Start: Thu Dec 14 17:40:49 2000
<BR>[17:40] Session Ident: Euthanasia45 <I>(IP deleted)</I>
<BR>[17:40] (Euthanasia45) I'm begining to feel stupid
<BR>[17:41] (stbdchick) how?
<BR>[17:41] (Euthanasia45) So much planning
<BR>[17:42] (Euthanasia45) and so much risk
<BR>[17:42] (Euthanasia45) maybe it is just a dumb idea to try to live my fantasy
<BR>[17:42] (Euthanasia45) something can always go wrong
<BR>[17:42] (Euthanasia45) that is unforseen
<BR>[17:42] (stbdchick) that is true
<BR>[17:42] (stbdchick) there is risk involved
<BR>[17:42] (Euthanasia45) and I'm dealing with unstable people
<BR>[17:43] (Euthanasia45) I would have to kill myself if I got cot, and I don't want to
<BR>[17:43] *** Euthanasia44 is on IRC
<BR>[17:43] *** Euthanasia44 has left IRC
<BR>Session Close: Thu Dec 14 17:43:49 2000</P>

<P>Session Start: Thu Dec 14 17:44:00 2000
<BR>[17:44] Session Ident: Euthanasia45 <I>(IP deleted)</I>
<BR>[17:44] (Euthanasia45) you know what happends to someone cot for cannibalism, it would be a world news event
<BR>[17:44] (stbdchick) you're quite right
<BR>[17:45] (Euthanasia45) part of me sees it as so easy, and the other part gets scared
<BR>[17:45] (stbdchick) Euth, you have always known the risks
<BR>[17:45] (stbdchick) you seemed fairly certain you could handle them
<BR>[17:46] (Euthanasia45) And I have never hurt a woman before in my life, so you might be right about what I can do
<BR>[17:46] (Euthanasia45) I'm in the middle
<BR>[17:46] (Euthanasia45) I have ben also thinking of how you could do this without me and not look like a suicide.
<BR>[17:46] (Euthanasia45) if I decide not to take the risk
<BR>[17:47] (Euthanasia45) I guess you would not let me call you would you?
<BR>[17:47] (stbdchick) my daughter is home
<BR>[17:47] (stbdchick) and a friend
<BR>[17:47] (Euthanasia45) I see
<BR>[17:47] (stbdchick) no way I could discuss this now
<BR>[17:47] (Euthanasia45) ok
<BR>[17:47] (Euthanasia45) I'm giving this so much thought
<BR>[17:48] (Euthanasia45) driven by desire instead of logic
<BR>[17:48] (Euthanasia45) I told you there was others who wanted me to kill them that knew nothing about the eating part
<BR>[17:49] (Euthanasia45) I talked on the phone today to one of them, and she is very dead serious.
<BR>[17:50] (stbdchick) where is she from?
<BR>[17:50] (Euthanasia45) Canada
<BR>[17:51] (Euthanasia45) she was going to put a knife in her stomach last night until I talked her out of that method
<BR>[17:52] (stbdchick) that would not be a good method
<BR>[17:52] (Euthanasia45) no
<BR>[17:52] (Euthanasia45) very painfull
<BR>[17:52] (stbdchick) extremely
<BR>[17:52] (stbdchick) also, too easy to be rescued
<BR>[17:52] (Euthanasia45) her first attempt was not very good either, she drank terpintine
<BR>[17:52] (stbdchick) this is not someone from the channel?
<BR>[17:53] (Euthanasia45) Got very sick, but of corse did not die
<BR>[17:53] (Euthanasia45) people choose such painful methods
<BR>[17:53] (Euthanasia45) it does not have to be like that
<BR>[17:53] (stbdchick) some people who are suicidal hate themselves and want to punish themselves
<BR>[17:53] (Euthanasia45) but you have me worried
<BR>[17:54] (stbdchick) worried how?
<BR>[17:54] (Euthanasia45) If i'm wrong about <I>(nick deleted)</I>, might I be wrong about you, or this other chick
<BR>[17:54] (Euthanasia45) maybe you all can be helped and I just don't know it
<BR>[17:55] (Euthanasia45) the way I can handle this is, if I don't do it, they will die a worse death, but die not matter what I do
<BR>[17:55] (Euthanasia45) and there is <I>(nick deleted)</I> now
<BR>[17:56] (Euthanasia45) But if someone can be helped, and I make death so easy for them, hmmmmm
<BR>[17:57] (stbdchick) I would think it depends on the individual situation
<BR>[17:57] (Euthanasia45) I think my being driven by desire is part of the problem
<BR>[17:57] (Euthanasia45) it is hard for me to see what maybe you can se
<BR>[17:58] (stbdchick) maybe
<BR>[17:58] (stbdchick) I don't have any desire whatsoever to see any of these people die
<BR>[17:58] (stbdchick) except me, of course
<BR>[17:58] (Euthanasia45) hahahha
<BR>[17:59] (Euthanasia45) You know, I came into here and got involved just to find meat, now I have made friends I also don't want to see anything happen too.
<BR>[17:59] (Euthanasia45) Getting close to anyone was not my plan
<BR>[18:00] (stbdchick) suicidal people are people too
<BR>[18:00] (Euthanasia45) yes
<BR>[18:00] (Euthanasia45) of corse
<BR>[18:01] (stbdchick) I have to go, <I>(nick deleted)</I> is gonna call me
<BR>[18:01] (stbdchick) talk to you later

<BR>[18:01] (Euthanasia45) I thought I had another option for you, but after reading up on it, not real good after all
<BR>Session Close: Thu Dec 14 18:02:07 2000</P>

<BR>[18:02] (Euthanasia45) something you need to know about the insurance money
<BR>[18:02] (Euthanasia45) they would only pay it to your daughter in about 7 or 10 years when your assumed to be dead.
<BR>[18:02] (Euthanasia45) ok, by
<BR>[18:02] (stbdchick) bye
