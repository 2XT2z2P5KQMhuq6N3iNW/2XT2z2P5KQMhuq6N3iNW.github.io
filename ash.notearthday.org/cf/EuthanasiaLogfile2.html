Session Start: Wed Dec 06 12:07:53 2000
<BR>[12:07] Session Ident: Euthanasia44 <I>(IP deleted)</I>
<BR>[12:07] (Euthanasia44) Hi, hows it going?
<BR>[12:08] (stbdchick) ok, how are you?
<BR>[12:08] (stbdchick) btw, thanks for the email - was sweet of you
<BR>[12:08] (Euthanasia44) doing good
<BR>[12:08] (Euthanasia44) did you get my message?
<BR>[12:08] (Euthanasia44) Oh ok, good
<BR>[12:09] (Euthanasia44) I was a little worried about you
<BR>[12:09] (Euthanasia44) you have not ben on much
<BR>[12:09] (stbdchick) I haven't heard from <I>(nick deleted)</I>, and he hasn't posted
<BR>[12:09] (stbdchick) so... he is probably gone
<BR>[12:09] (Euthanasia44) Well, it could have happend, and all we can do is accept it
<BR>[12:10] (Euthanasia44) there are more then 1 in here I know will be gone and I will miss them
<BR>[12:10] (stbdchick) true, unfortunate, but true
<BR>[12:10] (stbdchick) I feel badly though
<BR>[12:10] (stbdchick) I think it's awful that anyone has to face it alone
<BR>[12:11] (Euthanasia44) I'm trying to think of the girl from Norway, that is not in anymore, not sure if she jumped or what
<BR>[12:11] (stbdchick) no, I saw he earlier
<BR>[12:11] (stbdchick) he = her
<BR>[12:11] (Euthanasia44) How are you feeling? are you still planning on taking the bus?
<BR>[12:12] (Euthanasia44) Her, and was 17
<BR>[12:12] (stbdchick) probably fairly soon
<BR>[12:12] (stbdchick) I don't want to deal with going back to work
<BR>[12:12] (stbdchick) and money will run out soon
<BR>[12:12] (Euthanasia44) You know we don't want to lose you?
<BR>[12:12] (stbdchick) I know
<BR>[12:12] (Euthanasia44) but you have to do what you have to do
<BR>[12:13] (stbdchick) that's the bad thing about ASH - finding people who understand is... finding people you may lose
<BR>[12:13] (stbdchick) I'll have to give a couple people control voer the channel too
<BR>[12:13] (Euthanasia44) Your important here
<BR>[12:14] (Euthanasia44) you should give me the password
<BR>[12:14] (stbdchick) I'll email it to a few people before I go
<BR>[12:14] (stbdchick) I'm pretty decided on helium
<BR>[12:14] (Euthanasia44) good
<BR>[12:14] (stbdchick) I think it's likely to be as painless as one can get
<BR>[12:15] (Euthanasia44) I wish I could be with you when you do it
<BR>[12:15] (Euthanasia44) even if I don't really want you too
<BR>[12:15] (Euthanasia44) I would help you
<BR>[12:15] (stbdchick) help me?
<BR>[12:16] (Euthanasia44) like you said, it is not good to die alone
<BR>[12:16] (stbdchick) no, it's not
<BR>[12:16] (stbdchick) when I was gonna do it before... the dying part scares me
<BR>[12:16] (stbdchick) I wish my best friend would be there
<BR>[12:17] (stbdchick) death doesn't scare me - I figure the other side is... just nothing
<BR>[12:17] (stbdchick) it's the going that is scary
<BR>[12:17] (Euthanasia44) kid of hard to get that kind of support ha?
<BR>[12:17] (stbdchick) well, most people kinda freak out over the diea of suicide
<BR>[12:17] (stbdchick) most non-ASHers, I mean
<BR>[12:18] (stbdchick) makes me wish I just ahd cance4r or HIV or somehting
<BR>[12:18] (stbdchick) then they'd be supportive
<BR>[12:18] (Euthanasia44) I like the drug to knock you out first before death, then feel nothing
<BR>[12:19] (Euthanasia44) I know
<BR>[12:19] (Euthanasia44) but even if you were terminal, they would not let you die
<BR>[12:19] (stbdchick) I think helium is pretty fast, but that's kinda what's scary...
<BR>[12:20] (stbdchick) I dunno, I think they'd be more supportive if I were terminal, my friends, I mean - they just don't think the pain I'm in is as "real" as physical pain
<BR>[12:20] (Euthanasia44) with drugs that knock you out, you have a feeling of well being first while you go asleep, then you die with a smile on your face
<BR>[12:21] (Euthanasia44) what about you getting another job?
<BR>[12:21] (stbdchick) it's not my job
<BR>[12:21] (stbdchick) that's just another source of stress
<BR>[12:21] (stbdchick) it's 38 years of this shit
<BR>[12:21] (stbdchick) I'm just... tired
<BR>[12:21] (stbdchick) I don't want to deal with the grief anymore
<BR>[12:21] (Euthanasia44) is there anything you can point at that is the problem?
<BR>[12:21] (Euthanasia44) that could be changed?
<BR>[12:21] (stbdchick) it's not one thing
<BR>[12:22] (Euthanasia44) your daughter now is getting worried from what you have said?
<BR>[12:22] (stbdchick) my whole life... I was raised in an abusive family, lived on the streets for years, been raped, abused, etc... overcame ALL that... got pregnant... went to college alone, grad school alone, dirt pverty...
<BR>[12:23] (stbdchick) everything just keeps on... the stuff with my daughter isn't the problem... it's just the last straw
<BR>[12:23] (stbdchick) there's never been a period of time where my life wasn't a major struggle
<BR>[12:23] (stbdchick) yeah, she has been good since I quit going to work - behaves herself
<BR>[12:24] (Euthanasia44) bu you know it wont last
<BR>[12:24] (stbdchick) no, if I get better, she'll fuck up again
<BR>[12:24] (stbdchick) and I have done EVERYTHING there is to do about her
<BR>[12:24] (stbdchick) and quite frankly, I just can't keep doing it alone... it's *always* been me against the world, and I'm just too tired
<BR>[12:25] (Euthanasia44) so your going to die alone I guess
<BR>[12:26] (stbdchick) apparently
<BR>[12:26] (stbdchick) I don't want my daughter to find me, so I was thinking a hotel room
<BR>[12:26] (stbdchick) tho I dunno what excuse one would use for bringing a tank of helium in with you...heh
<BR>[12:27] (Euthanasia44) if you did not have your daughter how would it be for you now?
<BR>[12:27] (stbdchick) I dunno... I can't imagine not having her
<BR>[12:27] (stbdchick) my life has been about her for almost 2 decades now
<BR>[12:28] (Euthanasia44) Is there any part of you that still wants to live?
<BR>[12:28] (stbdchick) I can't imagine... what I would ever want in the future
<BR>[12:29] (stbdchick) I can't envision a life that would make me happy... something worth going through the grief for
<BR>[12:29] (stbdchick) so... no
<BR>[12:29] (Euthanasia44) hahahaha
<BR>[12:29] (Euthanasia44) not a hotel, a cabin
<BR>[12:30] (stbdchick) that's an idea... there are campsites up in Sullivan County that rent cabins
<BR>[12:30] (stbdchick) it's beautiful up there... and peaceful
<BR>[12:30] (Euthanasia44) rent it for a weekend
<BR>[12:31] (Euthanasia44) bring it in at night when no one is around
<BR>[12:31] (Euthanasia44) Or, you can do it in the middle of the woods
<BR>[12:31] (Euthanasia44) but then a bear might have you for a meal
<BR>[12:31] (Euthanasia44) still there?
<BR>[12:31] (stbdchick) no one is ever around
<BR>[12:31] (stbdchick) there's only like 3000 people in the whole county
<BR>[12:32] (stbdchick) and I wouldn't really care if a bear had me as a meal afterwards, I mean it's not like I'm gonna be using my body anymore
<BR>[12:34] (Euthanasia44) do you want your body found? or would you just like to disapear?
<BR>[12:34] (stbdchick) the thing is... if I'm found, they'll know it's suicide... and my daughter won't get my life insurance
<BR>[12:35] (stbdchick) before... before I was in therapy, and no one knew... I wanted to make it look accidental
<BR>[12:35] (stbdchick) but now they know I'm suicidal
<BR>[12:35] (stbdchick) so I dunno
<BR>[12:35] (Euthanasia44) yes, but do you want your body found?
<BR>[12:35] (Euthanasia44) do you want your daughter to know hwat you did?
<BR>[12:36] (Euthanasia44) how much is the insurance?
<BR>[12:36] (stbdchick) insurance is $140K
<BR>[12:36] (stbdchick) twice my salary
<BR>[12:36] (Euthanasia44) wow
<BR>[12:36] (stbdchick) I'd rather they didn't know I suicided
<BR>[12:36] (stbdchick) enough to get her through college anyways
<BR>[12:37] (Euthanasia44) lets think about that, I agree
<BR>[12:37] (stbdchick) I mean, I want her to be OK
<BR>[12:37] (Euthanasia44) it is better if you disapear never to be seen again
<BR>[12:37] (Euthanasia44) but not sure how long she has to wait to collect on the insurance
<BR>[12:37] (stbdchick) probably, then they can just report me missing... after a year or two, I think they presume you're dead
<BR>[12:37] (Euthanasia44) yes
<BR>[12:38] (Euthanasia44) about when do you want to do this?
<BR>[12:38] (stbdchick) sometimes I think about all this - and other times... I just... I don't care if she's OK, cause I'm just SO bad myself...
<BR>[12:38] (stbdchick) I can't believe <I>(nick deleted)</I>didn't show up
<BR>[12:38] (stbdchick) I dunno, soon though
<BR>[12:39] (stbdchick) I really don't want to hang around to lose many more people
<BR>[12:39] (stbdchick) I'm way too fragile for any more grief
<BR>[12:39] (Euthanasia44) yes
<BR>[12:39] (stbdchick) brb...getting coffee refill
<BR>[12:40] (Euthanasia44) would you have tried to talk him out of it?
<BR>[12:41] (Euthanasia44) ok
<BR>[12:42] (stbdchick) back
<BR>[12:43] (stbdchick) I dunno if I'd have tried to talk him out of it, to tell you the truth
<BR>[12:43] (stbdchick) it's not like he was a teenager, ya know?
<BR>[12:43] (stbdchick) he's in his early 40's...been dealing with being severely bipolar for years, and there's little hope of him getting better
<BR>[12:43] (stbdchick) I dunno
<BR>[12:44] (stbdchick) the selfish part of me would've wanted to talk him out of it
<BR>[12:44] (Euthanasia44) so what could you have done then if he did come over?
<BR>[12:44] (stbdchick) but... realistically, he is one of the people who probably should do it
<BR>[12:44] (stbdchick) I dunno, meet him anyways
<BR>[12:44] (Euthanasia44) I know that one
<BR>[12:44] (Euthanasia44) say goodbye
<BR>[12:45] (stbdchick) yes
<BR>[12:46] (Euthanasia44) so your not sure if you are enough about your daughter to plan it so she gets the insurance money?
<BR>[12:46] (Euthanasia44) back to being selfish
<BR>[12:46] (Euthanasia44) someone said suicidal people are selfish, think that is true?
<BR>[12:46] (stbdchick) the thing is, the insurance won't pay on suicide for 2 years... which would mean I'd hafta wait another year
<BR>[12:46] (stbdchick) and I can't imagine living through this for another year
<BR>[12:47] (stbdchick) of course, committing suicide is selfish
<BR>[12:47] (stbdchick) just... doesn't mean it's wrong
<BR>[12:47] (Euthanasia44) Well, if no one found your body
<BR>[12:47] (stbdchick) sometimes selfish is the right thing
<BR>[12:47] (stbdchick) if I rent a cabin in Sullivan County, someone is gonna find the body
<BR>[12:48] (stbdchick) unless a bear comes along after all  ;)
<BR>[12:48] (Euthanasia44) that is not what I had in mind
<BR>[12:48] (Euthanasia44) of corse someone would
<BR>[12:48] (Euthanasia44) I know how to do it in California
<BR>[12:49] (Euthanasia44) there is a very very deep lake
<BR>[12:49] (Euthanasia44) 16,000 feet deep
<BR>[12:49] (stbdchick) there's a lake THAT deep?
<BR>[12:50] (Euthanasia44) yep
<BR>[12:50] (Euthanasia44) lake Tahoe
<BR>[12:50] (Euthanasia44) the inside of a volkano
<BR>[12:50] (stbdchick) I dunno... I read a description of drowning... doesn't sound like a good method
<BR>[12:50] (Euthanasia44) 35 miles across
<BR>[12:50] (Euthanasia44) if your knocked out it is very peaceful
<BR>[12:51] (Euthanasia44) no pain with drowning
<BR>[12:51] (stbdchick) if I'm knocked out, jumping in a volcano would be difficult
<BR>[12:51] (Euthanasia44) but how you die is not the question
<BR>[12:51] (Euthanasia44) it is where your body goes
<BR>[12:51] (Euthanasia44) No, you would need help
<BR>[12:52] (Euthanasia44) if you came here, I would help you
<BR>[12:52] (Euthanasia44) ass long as you left no trail here
<BR>[12:52] (Euthanasia44) there are cabins here too along the lake
<BR>[12:53] (stbdchick) help me what?  dispose of my corpse?
<BR>[12:53] (Euthanasia44) you would never ben seen again
<BR>[12:53] (stbdchick) I mean... you would MOVE my dead body?  wouldn't that creep you out?
<BR>[12:53] (Euthanasia44) yep
<BR>[12:53] (Euthanasia44) in the middle of the lake
<BR>[12:54] (Euthanasia44) with weights
<BR>[12:54] (Euthanasia44) your daughter wins then
<BR>[12:55] (stbdchick) errr... how could you do that?
<BR>[12:55] (stbdchick) I mean, I've only been near dead bodies a few times
<BR>[12:55] (stbdchick) but when our last cat died... I couldn't even bury her, neighbor did it
<BR>[12:55] (Euthanasia44) you can choose whatever method of death you want
<BR>[12:55] (Euthanasia44) whatever feels the best for you
<BR>[12:57] (Euthanasia44) It would not bother me to help you, know how important it is for you
<BR>[12:57] (Euthanasia44) It is up to you
<BR>[12:57] (stbdchick) it doesn't creep you out?
<BR>[12:57] (stbdchick) I mean...I was with my dad when he died
<BR>[12:57] (stbdchick) and he wasn't THERE anymore if you know what I mean
<BR>[12:57] (stbdchick) his corpse made me very uncomfortable
<BR>[12:57] (stbdchick) it wasn't HIM
<BR>[12:58] (Euthanasia44) No, not with a friend
<BR>[12:58] (Euthanasia44) Yes
<BR>[12:58] (Euthanasia44) To many people have to go suicide alone
<BR>[12:58] (stbdchick) I know
<BR>[12:58] (stbdchick) how would we do this?
<BR>[12:58] (Euthanasia44) and makes it sohard
<BR>[12:59] (Euthanasia44) again, need to have an idea of when?
<BR>[12:59] (stbdchick) next week
<BR>[12:59] (Euthanasia44) Oh and tell me your body weight?
<BR>[12:59] (stbdchick) 180
<BR>[13:00] (Euthanasia44) you will be dead weight
<BR>[13:00] (stbdchick) yup, and not much time to diet between now and then  ;)
<BR>[13:00] (stbdchick) heh
<BR>[13:01] (stbdchick) may have to rent a crane
<BR>[13:02] (Euthanasia44) I need to know how much weight I have to handle?
<BR>[13:02] (stbdchick) have you like worked in a morgue or something?
<BR>[13:03] (Euthanasia44) hmmmmmmmm
<BR>[13:03] (Euthanasia44) I guess because your so tall
<BR>[13:03] (stbdchick) yeah, I'm 5'10"
<BR>[13:03] (Euthanasia44) I remember you said your 5-8
<BR>[13:04] (stbdchick) no, 5'10"
<BR>[13:04] (Euthanasia44) I would be the only one to move you
<BR>[13:05] (stbdchick) I meant... I meant how is it you are so matter-of-fact about moving bodies?
<BR>[13:05] (Euthanasia44) Oh ok, so is that your normal weight for being that tall?
<BR>[13:06] (stbdchick) well, it's normal for me... I am about 20-30 lbs overweight
<BR>[13:08] (Euthanasia44) or did you let yourself go?
<BR>[13:08] (Euthanasia44) I'm to fat, I'm about 200 lbs now and only 5-6, and was skinny for most of my life, hate it.
<BR>[13:09] (stbdchick) you gained weight with depression?
<BR>[13:11] (stbdchick) I gained gradually in college and grad school... studying until the middle of the night... had a fourth meal most days... and though I worked very hard, it was all sitting-on-my-butt kind of work
<BR>[13:12] (stbdchick) you there?

<BR>[15:15] (stbdchick) <-isn't anywhere *NEAR* a virgin
<BR>[15:15] (stbdchick) :)
<BR>[15:16] (Euthanasia44) No, in a lake that was formed from a volkano
<BR>[15:16] (stbdchick) I know, I'm just being a smart-ass
<BR>[15:16] (Euthanasia44) hahahhah
<BR>[15:16] (stbdchick) no matter how distraught I get, my mind still goes weird places

<BR>[15:17] (Euthanasia44) So do I, welcome to the club
<BR>[15:17] (Euthanasia44) and a sick humor

<BR>[15:18] (stbdchick) I dunno about this

<BR>[15:19] (stbdchick) I mean, what excuse would I have to go to CA?
<BR>[15:19] (stbdchick) 180 is aboiut 20 lbs overweight
<BR>[15:19] (Euthanasia44) Well, I'm a lot more then that over weight
<BR>[15:19] (Euthanasia44) your lucky
<BR>[15:20] (Euthanasia44) if you desapear, you don't tell anyone where your going
<BR>[15:20] (stbdchick) but I'll have to buy plane tickets
<BR>[15:20] (stbdchick) I mean, that can be tracked
<BR>[15:20] (Euthanasia44) But next week would not give me enough time to plan it
<BR>[15:20] (stbdchick) how much time do you need?
<BR>[15:21] (Euthanasia44) Well, would prefer Feb if you could wait that long?
<BR>[15:21] (stbdchick) why February?
<BR>[15:22] (Euthanasia44) Well, there might be someone else that also needs help as well in feb
<BR>[15:24] (Euthanasia44) just need to rent a cabin once
<BR>[15:24] (stbdchick) from ASH?
<BR>[15:24] (Euthanasia44) they are expensive there
<BR>[15:24] (stbdchick) why?  how much does a cabin cost?
<BR>[15:25] (Euthanasia44) somewhere over 200 per night for lake front
<BR>[15:25] (Euthanasia44) could you hold out until Feb?
<BR>[15:25] (stbdchick) much less expensive than paying living expenses for another few months
<BR>[15:26] (stbdchick) I could cover that
<BR>[15:26] (Euthanasia44) someone els might for you
<BR>[15:26] (Euthanasia44) make good use out of the place, kill two birds with one cabin, hahahaha
<BR>[15:27] (Euthanasia44) Just need to be sure you would not talk to anyone about this
<BR>[15:27] (Euthanasia44) and help be sure your not traced, and we can talk about that
<BR>[15:27] (stbdchick) who is it?>
<BR>[15:28] (stbdchick) I mean, I dunno how I feel aboiut someone else...
<BR>[15:28] (Euthanasia44) I would never tell you unless I had permission
<BR>[15:28] (Euthanasia44) It is another female
<BR>[15:28] (stbdchick) it's not a teenager, is it?
<BR>[15:28] (Euthanasia44) and you would not have to be there at the same time
<BR>[15:29] (Euthanasia44) the cabin would be rented for a week or two
<BR>[15:29] (Euthanasia44) No, over 30
<BR>[15:30] (Euthanasia44) I'm going to just have a vacation
<BR>[15:30] (stbdchick) why for a week or two?
<BR>[15:30] (stbdchick) oh
<BR>[15:30] (Euthanasia44) and do this with notice
<BR>[15:30] (Euthanasia44) without I mean
<BR>[15:30] (stbdchick) well, how do I buy plane tickets without being traced?  they check id when you board now
<BR>[15:30] (Euthanasia44) they look at your id?
<BR>[15:31] (Euthanasia44) well, I don't care about them knowing the place you went too
<BR>[15:31] (Euthanasia44) the airport
<BR>[15:31] (Euthanasia44) just the address of the cabin no one would know
<BR>[15:32] (Euthanasia44) So if you took a plane to Reno, no one would know you went to the lake or where
<BR>[15:32] (stbdchick) ok
<BR>[15:32] (stbdchick) you'd pick me up at the airport?
<BR>[15:33] (Euthanasia44) they would think your in Reno
<BR>[15:33] (stbdchick) or...i mean, they'd look if I got a rental car
<BR>[15:34] (Euthanasia44) either meet you there, or have you take a shuttle to the casinos at lake Tahoe, and then you take a cab or something to the cabin, no trace
<BR>[15:34] (stbdchick) I will have to think about this a bit
<BR>[15:34] (stbdchick) I'd feel a fool if...
<BR>[15:34] (Euthanasia44) I first have to work it out with the other woman, she has the money to pull this off
<BR>[15:34] (stbdchick) if we made plans, and at the last minute, I couldn't do it
<BR>[15:35] (Euthanasia44) yes?
<BR>[15:36] (stbdchick) I mena, I was gonna do it back in May... had everything set
<BR>[15:36] (stbdchick) damn, I wish I'd gone through with it
<BR>[15:36] (stbdchick) have you ever actually tried?
<BR>[15:36] (stbdchick) it's... incredibly scary
<BR>[15:36] (stbdchick) and lonely
<BR>[15:36] (Euthanasia44) what would you like me to do if you change your mind?
<BR>[15:37] (stbdchick) I don't want to change my mind
<BR>[15:37] (Euthanasia44) You could chose her method
<BR>[15:38] (stbdchick) choose her method?
<BR>[15:38] (stbdchick) her who?
<BR>[15:38] (Euthanasia44) you could be druged in a drink with a knock out drug, then killed without pain with drowning or suffacation
<BR>[15:39] (Euthanasia44) method yes
<BR>[15:39] (Euthanasia44) she wanted painless peaceful
<BR>[15:40] (stbdchick) a knock out drink is not gonna kill me
<BR>[15:40] (Euthanasia44) you don't need a tank
<BR>[15:40] (Euthanasia44) drowning you under water will
<BR>[15:40] (Euthanasia44) after your knocked out
<BR>[15:40] (stbdchick) I can';t drown myself if I'm unconscious!
<BR>[15:41] (Euthanasia44) No, but I can
<BR>[15:41] (stbdchick) that wouldn't be suicide, that would be murder
<BR>[15:41] (Euthanasia44) peaceful and painless and very sure to work
<BR>[15:42] (Euthanasia44) well, assisted suicide
<BR>[15:42] (Euthanasia44) but no one is going to know it, so whats the deference
<BR>[15:42] (stbdchick) if you got caught...
<BR>[15:43] (Euthanasia44) your body will never ben found, so no one is going to know how or if you died
<BR>[15:43] (Euthanasia44) and is the only reason I would do it
<BR>[15:43] (Euthanasia44) no body, no investagation
<BR>[15:43] (stbdchick) why would you take that kind of risk for me?
<BR>[15:44] (Euthanasia44) Because I'm about the only one that would
<BR>[15:44] (Euthanasia44) and you need help
<BR>[15:44] (stbdchick) what do you get out of this?
<BR>[15:44] (Euthanasia44) but I'm nocrusader
<BR>[15:45] (Euthanasia44) I believe in the right to assisted suicide, but I'm not out to get attention for it, hahhah
<BR>[15:45] (stbdchick) how do I know you're not an interventionist?
<BR>[15:45] (Euthanasia44) Oh no, never
<BR>[15:46] (Euthanasia44) I told you how I feel about it
<BR>[15:46] (stbdchick) I don't understand
<BR>[15:46] (Euthanasia44) I would rather have you alive, but
<BR>[15:46] (stbdchick) I might help a close friend... knowing it'd be risky... 
<BR>[15:47] (Euthanasia44) If your going to die and I help you, it will be peaceful I know that for sure
<BR>[15:48] (Euthanasia44) I know no one can talk you out of it, so the next best thing is, to help you
<BR>[15:49] (stbdchick) you're doing this with someone else too?  what are you ASH's own Dr. Kevorkian?!?
<BR>[15:49] (Euthanasia44) but, it's up to you
<BR>[15:49] (stbdchick) heh
<BR>[15:49] (Euthanasia44) don't ask, hahhaha
<BR>[15:49] (Euthanasia44) I don't like him anyway
<BR>[15:50] (Euthanasia44) to much attention
<BR>[15:50] (Euthanasia44) and only for termanal
<BR>[15:50] (stbdchick) life is terminal
<BR>[15:50] (Euthanasia44) Others need help too
<BR>[15:50] (Euthanasia44) this is true, hahhhaa
<BR>[15:51] (Euthanasia44) you think your going to back out at the last minute?
<BR>[15:51] (stbdchick) I think that actually doing it is very hard
<BR>[15:51] (Euthanasia44) your right
<BR>[15:51] (stbdchick) I mean... have you ever played with hanging?
<BR>[15:52] (Euthanasia44) Not me
<BR>[15:52] (stbdchick) like... when you realize you are losing consciousness... that you are actually gonna die... it's really fucking scary
<BR>[15:52] (Euthanasia44) have you?
<BR>[15:52] (Euthanasia44) I probably would not hang you the way you tried if I was to hang someone
<BR>[15:53] (stbdchick) how would you hang someone?
<BR>[15:53] (Euthanasia44) Use a real noose and have a drop, then kick out the chair, and it is too late to think about it, the neck breaks and its over
<BR>[15:53] (stbdchick) it'd be the exact opposite of suspension play in SM... doing the opposite of all the safety rules
<BR>[15:54] (Euthanasia44) I forgot about your BDSM
<BR>[15:54] (Euthanasia44) do you want a kinky method? hahhhaa
<BR>[15:54] (stbdchick) I sort of have kinky associations with hanging
<BR>[15:54] (Euthanasia44) Tell me?
<BR>[15:55] (stbdchick) I just mean... it's a controversial thing in SM
<BR>[15:55] (stbdchick) some people think any form of playing with breath control cannot be done safely
<BR>[15:55] (Euthanasia44) ok, I don't know about it
<BR>[15:55] (stbdchick) and some are really into it
<BR>[15:55] (stbdchick) I never played with it during my time in SM...
<BR>[15:56] (Euthanasia44) As I said, if I hanged you, neck break
<BR>[15:56] (Euthanasia44) quick
<BR>[15:56] (Euthanasia44) no backing out of it
<BR>[15:56] (stbdchick) but it's one of those things... like an old boyfriend described to me what heroin was like... he made it sound so awesome, you almost wanted to try it yourself
<BR>[15:56] (stbdchick) and... some of the folks into breath-play have made it sound that way... very intense apparently
<BR>[15:57] (Euthanasia44) you like the idea of being strangled slow?
<BR>[15:57] (Euthanasia44) is that it?
<BR>[15:58] (stbdchick) I like the descriptions I've heard of it - sounds hot - though I always thought it was too dangerous
<BR>[15:58] (Euthanasia44) Well, if your going to die anyway, hahaha
<BR>[15:58] (stbdchick) it's sorta backwards now... being suicidal is about finding things that are dangerous ENOUGH... so you don't accidentally live through an attempt
<BR>[15:58] (Euthanasia44) yes
<BR>[15:59] (Euthanasia44) but most people don't have someone to be sure it works like you do if you want my help
<BR>[15:59] (Euthanasia44) So if you had your way, wich way would you go?
<BR>[16:00] (stbdchick) I would want to be sure
<BR>[16:00] (stbdchick) that's the main thing
<BR>[16:00] (Euthanasia44) Is death a sexual experience for you?
<BR>[16:01] (stbdchick) I never really thought of it as sexual per se
<BR>[16:01] (stbdchick) I mean, SM of course is
<BR>[16:01] (Euthanasia44) like SM?
<BR>[16:01] (stbdchick) so there's associations with hanging
<BR>[16:01] (stbdchick) but none of my SM fanatsies ahve ever included death
<BR>[16:02] (Euthanasia44) Oh ok
<BR>[16:02] (stbdchick) ya know, just regular old whips and chains and stuff
<BR>[16:02] (Euthanasia44) hahhaha
<BR>[16:02] (stbdchick) safe, sane and consensual...blah, blah, blah
<BR>[16:02] (stbdchick) heh
<BR>[16:02] (Euthanasia44) do you want to wear your leather when you die?
<BR>[16:03] (stbdchick) <-been in the scene for ten years
<BR>[16:03] (stbdchick) most of my leather is whips
<BR>[16:03] (Euthanasia44) So are you a dom? or sub?
<BR>[16:03] (stbdchick) I've done both
<BR>[16:04] (Euthanasia44) wich do you like the most?
<BR>[16:04] (stbdchick) started as a sub, but had some bad experiences trust-wise, started domming a bit... then kinda moved to exclusively domming after a while
<BR>[16:04] (stbdchick) I like them... differently
<BR>[16:04] (stbdchick) is hard to explain
<BR>[16:05] (Euthanasia44) do you like pain?
<BR>[16:05] (Euthanasia44) Or just power?
<BR>[16:05] (stbdchick) both
<BR>[16:05] (stbdchick) not either one alone
<BR>[16:05] (stbdchick) there is no point to pain if it's not part of submission
<BR>[16:06] (Euthanasia44) Years ago I had a girl friend that was very submissive and liked pain, but I was not into whipping anyone
<BR>[16:06] (Euthanasia44) I enjoyed her submission
<BR>[16:06] (stbdchick) too bad she wans't into drowning
<BR>[16:06] (stbdchick) heh
<BR>[16:06] (Euthanasia44) But other then hard biting, that was as far as I could go on the ;ain
<BR>[16:07] (stbdchick) I've done a lot... physically, mroe as a sub
<BR>[16:07] (stbdchick) I was beaten once so badly I couldn't shower even with plain water for 3 days
<BR>[16:07] (stbdchick) the bruises lasted over a month
<BR>[16:08] (Euthanasia44) wow
<BR>[16:08] (stbdchick) never beat anyone that abdly myself though, I'm kinda wimpier about inflicting pain
<BR>[16:08] (Euthanasia44) what shape is you body in now?
<BR>[16:08] (stbdchick) not as good as it should be
<BR>[16:08] (Euthanasia44) you have scars?
<BR>[16:09] (stbdchick) a few
<BR>[16:09] (stbdchick) and a few extra holes... heh
<BR>[16:09] (stbdchick) my right nipple is pierced
<BR>[16:09] (Euthanasia44) what do you think is wrong with your body now after being into BDSM?
<BR>[16:09] (stbdchick) and my inner labia used to be pierced, but I removed the rings, so there's just holes left
<BR>[16:09] (stbdchick) SM didn't mess up my body
<BR>[16:09] (stbdchick) overeating, smoking, lack of exercise... these messed up my body
<BR>[16:10] (Euthanasia44) I used to smoke as well
<BR>[16:10] (Euthanasia44) what do you think is your best feture?
<BR>[16:10] (Euthanasia44) feature
<BR>[16:10] (stbdchick) my hair probably
<BR>[16:11] (stbdchick) I have very thick, curly, long hair
<BR>[16:11] (stbdchick) EXTREMELY thick
<BR>[16:11] (Euthanasia44) is it long?
<BR>[16:11] (stbdchick) not real long, past my shoulders though
<BR>[16:11] (stbdchick) it doesn't grow real long
<BR>[16:11] (Euthanasia44) I would guessed you would have said your legs because your so tall
<BR>[16:12] (Euthanasia44) I would think your all legs
<BR>[16:12] (stbdchick) heh
<BR>[16:12] (stbdchick) well, they reach the ground
<BR>[16:12] (stbdchick) a good length for legs
<BR>[16:12] (stbdchick) ;)
<BR>[16:13] (Euthanasia44) but you don't think they have a nice shape?
<BR>[16:13] (stbdchick) I dunno, I'm not much into legs, I guess
<BR>[16:13] (stbdchick) I'm more into tits myself, when I look at chicks, that's what I tend to notice
<BR>[16:14] (Euthanasia44) do you carry your extra weight in your tummy? or your hips like most women?
<BR>[16:14] (Euthanasia44) Men have the large belly
<BR>[16:14] (Euthanasia44) Like me
<BR>[16:14] (Euthanasia44) hahaha
<BR>[16:15] (stbdchick) more in my belly... women's pants don't fit me right, the hips are too big... I buy men's jeans
<BR>[16:15] (Euthanasia44) So you like breasts?
<BR>[16:15] (stbdchick) but mostly I wear very long skirts and blouses
<BR>[16:15] (Euthanasia44) large? small? or inbetween?
<BR>[16:15] (stbdchick) I like large breasts
<BR>[16:16] (Euthanasia44) are your's large as well?
<BR>[16:16] (Euthanasia44) being so tall?
<BR>[16:16] (stbdchick) pretty large, D cup
<BR>[16:16] (Euthanasia44) wow
<BR>[16:16] (stbdchick) they don't look veyr large on my frame though
<BR>[16:17] (stbdchick) also, they're old... baby-chewed, gravity effects, etc.
<BR>[16:17] (Euthanasia44) yes, you would look in perportion
<BR>[16:17] (Euthanasia44) they are begining to sag a bit ha?
<BR>[16:17] (stbdchick) yup
<BR>[16:18] (Euthanasia44) does that get to you?
<BR>[16:19] (stbdchick) not really
<BR>[16:19] (stbdchick) I mean, that's just age
<BR>[16:19] (stbdchick) <-is not very hung up about looks
<BR>[16:19] (stbdchick) <-and not interested in anyone who *is* hung up about looks either
<BR>[16:19] (Euthanasia44) true, but I hate changing
<BR>[16:19] (stbdchick) besides, I'm not planning to date again
<BR>[16:20] (Euthanasia44) no, not much point
<BR>[16:21] (Euthanasia44) you only had 1 kid right?
<BR>[16:21] (stbdchick) yes
<BR>[16:21] (stbdchick) she's been quite enough tho
<BR>[16:21] (Euthanasia44) well, your breasts can't be that chewed up then
<BR>[16:22] (stbdchick) heh... no, but they look very different from pre-baby
<BR>[16:22] (stbdchick) babies change them a lot
<BR>[16:22] (Euthanasia44) yes
<BR>[16:23] (Euthanasia44) and the larger and more weight, the more they will sag as you age
<BR>[16:23] (stbdchick) yup
<BR>[16:23] (Euthanasia44) In other women, do you like older or younger breasts?
<BR>[16:23] (stbdchick) hard to say
<BR>[16:24] (stbdchick) my ideal woman is the one I fell in love with... whom was ten eyars older than me and had many more stretch marks
<BR>[16:24] (Euthanasia44) would your breasts be desirable to you if you were another woman looking at them?
<BR>[16:24] (stbdchick) oh yeah
<BR>[16:24] (stbdchick) I once caught a view of myself in the mirror nude, didn't recognize myself for a sec, and got attracted
<BR>[16:24] (stbdchick) weird, huh?
<BR>[16:24] (Euthanasia44) good, that is all that is important then
<BR>[16:25] (Euthanasia44) No, would not say that
<BR>[16:25] (stbdchick) I am gonna have to go... am falling asleep...
<BR>[16:26] (stbdchick) my sleep schedule is all messed up
<BR>[16:26] (Euthanasia44) You must think I'm weird
<BR>[16:26] (stbdchick) I think this convo has gotten weird
<BR>[16:26] (Euthanasia44) hahahah
<BR>[16:26] (stbdchick) but we've had weird convos in the main channel too... were you here when we discussed who had or had not tasted their own body fluids?
<BR>[16:26] (Euthanasia44) Well, you can stop it anytime you like, hahha
<BR>[16:26] (stbdchick) I need some sleep... have been up for a day and a half
<BR>[16:27] (stbdchick) I'll catch you later
<BR>[16:27] (Euthanasia44) No, was not there
<BR>[16:27] (Euthanasia44) sorry I missed it
<BR>[16:27] (Euthanasia44) Ok, see ya
