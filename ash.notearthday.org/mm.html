<p><a name="1">&quot;Tears of Innocent&quot;</a>
<p>A tear of sweet innocents traveling far away in the night,<br>
A dream of fears and danger that grows closer in the night,<br>
A dream of thunder and lightning roaring thoughout the day.,<br>
A dream of a sweet innocent child who only wants to play,<br>
<p>A touch of love and happiness<br>
A gift of love not yet known,<br>
A child's lost innocents that was only taken away<br>
As the stars above whisper in the silence of the story untold<br>
<p>A tear of pain and sorrow that always goes unheld,<br>
A tear of a fallen heart that has not yet yelled,<br>
A tear no one seams to hear<br>
As the silence goes on in fear.<br>
<p>-Michelle Schweiss-

<hr>
<p><a name="2">&quot;Daddy's Touch&quot;</a>
<p>A touch of daddy's eye<br>
That makes a little girl cry,<br>
A touch of daddy's hand<br>
That only makes you want to stand,<br>
A touch of daddy's voice<br>
That does not rejoice,<br>
A touch of innocents<br>
That does not yet exist,
<p>They say that this is love<br>
So what happen to things like this,
<p>A touch of daddy's eye<br>
That lights up the sky<br>
A touch of daddy's hand<br>
That helps you stand<br>
Touch of daddy's voice<br>
That only rejoices,<br>
A touch of innocents<br>
That is always in existence.
<p>-Michelle Schweiss-

<hr>
<p><a name="3">&quot;Standing Alone&quot;</a>
<p>My heart broken in two<br>
As I take the final step,<br>
The ending that I wish not to see
<p>Is coming closer to me,<br>
Love that I once known<br>
I know not if there is,
<p>Destruction that goes untold<br>
I could stay and live of hope
<p>Of dreams and happiness<br>
That might come back one day,<br>
I wish you could see<br>
Things from my eyes<br>
<p>For I wish not to hurt you so,<br>
The pain I feel is deep,<br>
The sweet and innocent sorrow<br>
Of something that was so sweet,
<p>How can I say good-bye<br>
To one I love so,<br>
I cherish in my heart<br>
<p>The happiness that is untold,<br>
Never again shall I love<br>
I will always stand alone<br>
In a heart of a broken soul.
<p>-Michelle Schweiss-
<p>&nbsp;
<hr>
<p><a name="4">&quot;Dreams of Yesterday&quot;</a>
<p>Far and long ago in a dream of yesterday
<p>In a field of fallen snow,<br>
In a child's dream of innocent<br>
Of love that no one knows,<br>
A cast of hope lye in the eyes<br>
Of love that only passes by,<br>
A sweet innocence that only knows to cry.
<p>-Michelle Schweiss-
<p>&nbsp;
<hr>
<p><a name="5">&quot;Ariel&quot;</a>
<p>A smile that sparkles as bright as the stars up in the sky<br>
Radiant as the glimmering moonlight,<br>
In your heart as pure as gold your<br>
Eyes that sparkle and shine with a<br>
Laughter that fills your daddy's soul.
<p>-Michelle Schweiss-
<p>&nbsp;
<hr>
<p><a name="6">&quot;Kayla&quot;</a>
<p>Kind and gentle as the summer breeze,<br>
As a angel up in the sky,<br>
You fill my heart with joy<br>
Laughter and happiness<br>
An angel in daddy's eyes.
<p>-Michelle Schweiss-
<p>&nbsp;
<hr>
<p><a name="7">Tammy&quot;</a>
<p>Treasure is in her heart of gold,<br>
As the stars up in the sky,<br>
Momma's little angel,<br>
My sweet and tender child,<br>
Your the sweet gift of love God has given me.
<p>-Michelle Schweiss-
<p>&nbsp;
<hr>
<p><a name="8">&quot;Chastity&quot;</a>
<p>Cast of shimmering glimmer in her eyes<br>
Heart as pure as gold.<br>
An angel in the arms of love,<br>
Smile as bright as the sun radiate glow.<br>
Taking the young boys heart in her soul,<br>
Intrapped by her beauty, of innocents .<br>
Tangled forever in the<br>
Young web of love, as pure as the fallen snow.
<p>-Michelle Schweiss-
<p>&nbsp;
<hr>
<p><a name="9">&quot;Sarah&quot;</a>
<p>Stars that sparkle up in the sky<br>
An angel in her momma's eye<br>
Radiant as the glimmering moonlight<br>
A laughter that shines in the bright sunlight<br>
Happiness that grows as a white rose.
<p>-Michelle Schweiss-
<p>&nbsp;
<hr>
<p><a name="10">&quot;Stephaine&quot;</a>
<p>Splendor as the first flower in the spring time<br>
Tender as the first fallen snow.<br>
Eyes of glitter that shimmer in the night Pleasant as a white dove flying free<br>
Hair made of pure gold as pretty as can be<br>
A star that gazes down from above<br>
Nothing ever as delightful to see<br>
In the eyes of the angels from above<br>
Everyone's loves Stephanie.
<p>-Michelle Schwiess-
<p>&nbsp;
<hr>
<p><a name="11">&quot;Tersha&quot;</a>
<p>Tender and sweet as the soft summer breeze<br>
Eyes that shine as the radiant moonlight<br>
Running free as an eagle up in the sky<br>
An angle in her momma's eye<br>
Shinning beyond the bright blue sky<br>
Her laughter reaching the stars above<br>
A graceful child of love.
<p>-Michelle Schweiss-
<p>&nbsp;
<hr>
<p><a name="12">&quot;The Fierce Wind&quot;</a>
<p>The wind blows fierce,<br>
The sky is gray, Coming down Twisting Tuning
<p>Falling to destruction<br>
Of what gets in the way<br>
Of a wind as fierce as can be,<br>
The sound of a train passes<br>
Flattening everything it sees,<br>
A wind as fierce as thee<br>
How can you see<br>
That I would like you<br>
To be genteel to me.<br>
<p>-Michelle Schweiss-
<p>&nbsp;
<hr>
<p><a name="13">&quot;Seasons&quot;</a>
<p>Turning of the seasons<br>
Changing of the suns,<br>
No one knows the reasons<br>
Or why they're so much fun,<br>
Spring is when the birds sing<br>
Summer has the sun's radiant glow<br>
Autumn is for fallen things<br>
Winter is the first fallen snow,
<p>Seasons are the turning<br>
Of many things yet to be,<br>
A fire that is burning<br>
That you and I can't see.
<p>-Michelle Schweiss-
<p>&nbsp;
<hr>
<p><a name="14">&quot;Deflowering&quot;</a>
<p>Walking in a daze<br>
Of fear and anger<br>
You had forced upon me,<br>
I will always remember<br>
The touch of a hand<br>
That no longer is near,<br>
The scent of your body<br>
Lingers on and on<br>
Causing fear in every corner
<p>As I try to go on,
<p>I shiver at<br>
The touch of a stranger,<br>
Never to understand<br>
What it was I did wrong,<br>
Your rage, desire, control<br>
Striping me form my cloths,<br>
A anger that keeps me<br>
Living in fear,<br>
I asked you to stop<br>
You did not hear,<br>
I pleaded with you<br>
To end the fear,
<p>I screamed<br>
For anyone to hear,
<p>I begged you<br>
To stop the pain<br>
That now lives<br>
Within me everyday<br>
And on into the night,<br>
You changed my life
<p>for eternity,<br>
As I close my eyes<br>
you are always near<br>
I wake screaming<br>
Because I feel you
<p>In my tears,<br>
The pain that never
<p>Goes away<br>
Only waits for the next day,<br>
Checking behind each corner<br>
Wondering if you're there,
<p>I sleep no more<br>
A peaceful sleep,<br>
My innocents<br>
Is yours to keep<br>
Gone by the touch of your hand,<br>
as I try to wash away<br>
The part of you<br>
That lives<br>
Within me everyday,<br>
You took me freely<br>
As your heart desired<br>
At whatever cost<br>
It did not matter to you
<p>Left with only<br>
The hope that one day<br>
All the fears and pain<br>
Will be washed away,<br>
As I lay in my tears Crying over things I should of done To stop you
<p>from tearing me in two.
<p>-Michelle Schwiess-
