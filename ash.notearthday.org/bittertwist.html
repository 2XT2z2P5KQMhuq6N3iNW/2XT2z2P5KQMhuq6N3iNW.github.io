<p align="center">
once upon a time there was upon a man a great weight.</p>
<p align="center">what this weight was, he did not know. he only felt it grow.</p>
<p align="center">it grew so large, cast a shadow do deep and dark, all was dimmed by it.</p>
<p align="center">the sun shone, but did not brighten him,</p>
<p align="center">the air was sweet and clear, but did not delight him</p>
<p align="center">the sky was so blue, you would wish to dive up into it,</p>
<p align="center">to be lost forever within and have it full you to the brim with is sparkling <br>
blue shades.</p>
<p align="center">but the man, he knew nothing of this,</p>
<p align="center">for the great weight that he carried crippled him to such things.</p>
<p align="center">his view of the world was tarnished and confined.</p>
<p align="center">he saw the gray streets slick with last nights rain and dirty rainbows made <br>
from leaked oil.</p>
<p align="center">he saw the crushed beer cans and cigarette butts littering the walkways.</p>
<p align="center">he saw the homeless, the life and intelligence in their eyes.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">he thought they looked at ease in their home, like they had always been <br>
there and would continue to be there.</p>
<p align="center">he wondered how they could bare it. letting go of everything.</p>
<p align="center">having everything taken away.</p>
<p align="center">perhaps, he thought, it would be nice. to have nothing.</p>
<p align="center">the man shuddered, and walked the brisk walk to work.</p>
<p align="center">a stranger in a crowd of strangers.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">each morning this man went to work, each evening he went home,</p>
<p align="center">each year he went on holiday, each Christmas he spent with his family.</p>
<p align="center">he had a nice car. he wore nice suits. if he wanted something, he bought it.</p>
<p align="center">though if he were honest with himself, and he very rarely was, he would say <br>
that he didn't really want it.</p>
<p align="center">he didn't know what he wanted.</p>
<p align="center">he just wanted something that he could not find,</p>
<p align="center">he was unaware that he was even looking.</p>
<p align="center">so every day this man went to work, and the weight grew, and its shadow <br>
grew.</p>
<p align="center">this did not go unnoticed by the people he knew, and one by one they all <br>
seemed to disappear.</p>
<p align="center">the man felt alone. tired. even his family seemed like strangers.</p>
<p align="center">he needed something, but no matter what he bought, it never satisfied.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">one day he went to a high place.</p>
<p align="center">from that place, he saw all the world laid out before him like an unfinished <br>
pattern.</p>
<p align="center">the sun shone warmly,  the air was sweet, clear and laden with many scents,</p>
<p align="center">the wind blew in cool airy gusts,</p>
<p align="center">the sky was so blue, you would wish to dive up into it.</p>
<p align="center">but this he did not see, for the weight was crushing him, darkness pulling <br>
him down.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">and so he fell. plummeted down, answering the earths call to claim him.</p>
<p align="center">and as he fell a strange thing happened.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">if someone had been watching, they would have seen a man falling,</p>
<p align="center">a man with a darkness about him,</p>
<p align="center">a heaviness around him that could not seen, only felt</p>
<p align="center">and then... and then they separated.</p>
<p align="center">the darkness dropped from the man, or did the man rise from the darkness?</p>
<p align="center">the weight continued to fall, but the man, he flew.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">he soared on wings touched gold by the sun,</p>
<p align="center">he looked about him with keen new eyes, and he saw.</p>
<p align="center">the world was not a perfect place, not always a happy place.</p>
<p align="center">but, he thought, it was, could be, a beautiful, marvelous world.</p>
<p align="center">a world of many colours, shades of light and darkness.</p>
<p align="center">but, he thought, not for him.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">the sun shone warmly, and it brighten him,</p>
<p align="center">the air was sweet, clear and laden with many scents, and it delight him</p>
<p align="center">and the wind blew in cool airy gusts, and he danced.</p>
<p align="center">the sky was so blue, you would wish to dive up into it,</p>
<p align="center">to be lost forever within and have it full you to the brim with is sparkling <br>
blue shades.
