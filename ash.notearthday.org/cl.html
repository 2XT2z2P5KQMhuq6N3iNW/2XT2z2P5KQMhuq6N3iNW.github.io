Crimson</P>
<P align="center">Pale white skin,<br>
Black soul inside<br>
Hidden from view<br>
My time, do I bide.</P>
<P align="center">Time until I can leave<br>
My body at last still<br>
Ending this mortal existence<br>
By my own free will.</P>
<P align="center">Blood, trickling red<br>
Running down a white thigh<br>
Affirmation of life<br>
Even as soul wants to die</P>
<P align="center">Quick flash of silver<br>
Pain in sharp lances<br>
Silent cry of anguish<br>
Quick downward glances</P>
<P align="center">The pain brings release<br>
From the black hole within<br>
I watch as I bleed<br>
I cry as I sin</P>
<P align="center">The shameful despair<br>
The unanswered guilt<br>
Overshadowing the emptiness<br>
Held inside walls that I've built</P>
<P align="center">What will I do<br>
I don't know where to turn<br>
Such a burden to share<br>
Will only concern</P>
<P align="center">Those close to me worry<br>
They see empty sad eyes<br>
I tell them I'm fine<br>
They see through the lies.</P>
<P align="center">But what should I do?<br>
I can't tell them the truth<br>
They'd look back with horror<br>
At this twisted, hurt youth</P>
<P align="center">So I sit silently,<br>
Knowing it's for the best<br>
Watching crimson against white<br>
Until my final rest.</P>
<hr class="divider-line">
<p align="center" class="item-title">
Deaf Angel</p><p align="center">
The world spins wildly<br>
tilting on its axis as a<br>
glittering array of decadent<br>
indecent<br>
wasteful<br>
colors swirl all around me as I<br>
stand numbly<br>
in the midst of the chaos<br>
seeing, not watching<br>
hearing, not listening<br>
touching, not feeling<br>
far past the point of any sensation.</P>
<P align="center">Stumbling, drunkenly, down a<br>
twisting and askew corridor<br>
with every door the same<br>
and every room holding a<br>
ticking<br>
time-bomb<br>
which I must rush to defuse<br>
while three others explode in its stead.</P>
<P align="center">Head ringing, teeth clenched<br>
slowly losing steam<br>
losing the will to push onward<br>
not caring to defuse the bombs<br>
not even caring they exist<br>
stopping my mad dash down the<br>
corridor to Hell<br>
my own personal torture.</P>
<P align="center">Dropping hints left and right<br>
up and down<br>
sideways, backwards, and headoverheels<br>
hearing them land on thick skulls<br>
with a dull plunk and a kneejerk nod<br>
a promise to help<br>
and a lie with an angel's intent<br>
as the plea falls unregarded<br>
upon deaf ears who listen to all<br>
and who hear nothing<br>
save their own<br>
agenda.</P>
<P align="center">I cry out<br>
painfully<br>
placed upon the Rack and bolted down<br>
with iron fittings<br>
unable to get up<br>
lacking the power to try<br>
moving painfully as the Rack stretches<br>
pulling in every direction<br>
as I try to accommodate<br>
scurrying along like a gutter rat<br>
eyes downcast and hands trembling<br>
seeking desperately to please<br>
seeking desperately the praise<br>
which never comes from<br>
deaf ears' angel lips.</P>
<P align="center">Stretched in infinite ways<br>
unnaturally<br>
able to move in only one<br>
yet trying to defy the fates<br>
defy the gods above<br>
and move in every direction<br>
pulled at once.<br>
Failure is a given<br>
but why should a given be<br>
accepted<br>
or<br>
acceptable.<br>
It is not made an option<br>
a choice<br>
for I am expected to succeed in all ways<br>
to move in every way stretched<br>
to soar effortlessly<br>
or at least, for looks' sake,<br>
apparently effortlessly.</P>
<P align="center">Yet how can a swan fly if it is being at the same time<br>
tied and pulled underwater.<br>
How does the cheetah blur past<br>
if it is being made to run backwards<br>
and forwards at once<br>
ending up<br>
not moving from the starting block.</P>
<P align="center">It catches up in the end<br>
takes its toll<br>
this endlessly painful stretching.<br>
Stealing from the body the will to move<br>
to breathe<br>
to so much as care<br>
for caring takes effort<br>
effort requires energy<br>
and none of it is there<br>
when efforts have proved so fruitless<br>
the cheetah standing still when two sides<br>
both expect it to succeed<br>
and neither side cares about the other.</P>
<P align="center">One decision to make<br>
one path to take<br>
and eventually another may meet up.<br>
But how to go about getting off the Rack<br>
telling the deaf angel that failure exists<br>
and has been<br>
met<br>
face to face.<br>
I must choose.<br>
Meet with failure, and open my soul<br>
show the failure and accept<br>
scrutiny.<br>
Painful<br>
required.<br>
One choice.<br>
I know the choice.<br>
But do I know the road to get there?</P>

<P align="center" class="dbl-indent">Welcome to the roller coaster from Hell.  We hope you enjoy your ride with<span lang="en-us">
</span>us today.</P>
<P align="center" class="dbl-indent">Please buckle your safety strap, located behind your head, across your eyes.<span lang="en-us">&nbsp;
</span>It prevents you from noticing the world as it spins out of control.</P>
<P align="center" class="dbl-indent">Leg shackles can be found at your feet.  Fasten them across your ankles to<span lang="en-us">
</span>prevent any willful movements, which may cause the ride to stop.</P>
<P align="center" class="dbl-indent">Similar restraints can be found at the wrists.  Tighten them to the point of<span lang="en-us">
</span>loss of blood flow, numbing extremities to the extreme changes in<span lang="en-us">
</span>temperature.</P>
<P align="center" class="dbl-indent">Persons experiencing healthy relationships should not board unless<span lang="en-us">
</span>accompanied by significant other, so that both may experience ride to hell<span lang="en-us">
</span>together.</P>
<P align="center" class="dbl-indent">As we reach the peak, please exit the coaster.  We assume no responsibility<span lang="en-us">
</span>for damages caused by the sheer drop to the ground.</P>
<P align="center" class="dbl-indent">During the drop to the ground, please grab all family members and/or friends<span lang="en-us">
</span>that you may encounter on the way and drag them down with you.</P>
<P align="center" class="dbl-indent">Take time you clean up the mess left at the bottom as you stumble bloodied<span lang="en-us">
</span>to your feet.  No one else is responsible for helping you to undo what has<span lang="en-us">
</span>been done, and most will no longer speak to you.</P>
<P align="center" class="dbl-indent">At the bottom of the coaster you will find a wooden cart waiting to take you<span lang="en-us">
</span>back to the top at blinding speed.  On the way up, enjoy all that you pass<span lang="en-us">
</span>and view the world from the slanted angle provided by your position.<span lang="en-us">
</span>Make<span lang="en-us"> </span>sure to tell everyone you come into contact with just what you are<span lang="en-us">
</span>experiencing, regardless of his or her wont to listen.</P>
<P align="center" class="dbl-indent">As you prepare to disembark from the coaster this time at its peak, please<span lang="en-us">
</span>remember to attach your complimentary weighted shackles to your head, back,<span lang="en-us">
</span>wrists, and feet.  They will assist you in your work at the bottom, should<span lang="en-us">
</span>you reach it alive.  Head restraints will add the necessary weight to cause<span lang="en-us">
</span>headaches and make it ten times harder to lift your head from bed each<span lang="en-us">
</span>morning.  Back weights will give you the necessary sloth movements and<span lang="en-us">
</span>slouched position, along with feet shackles.  Please also accept our gift of<span lang="en-us">
</span>weighted wristbands, to keep you from performing daily tasks easily.</P>
<P align="center" class="dbl-indent">Thank you again for joining us on the roller coaster from Hell.  You will<span lang="en-us">
</span>return again soon.</P><hr class="divider-line">

cutting through my soul<br>
aiming at my heart<br>
but i was smart<br>
i had walls<br>

but they couldn't come close<br>

scared to be rejected<br>

i thought these people were friends<br>
mean turned on me<br>
mea culpa.</P><hr class="divider-line">

<P align="center" class="item-title">You Laughed</P>
<P align="center">I hate you for what you did<br>
Not "I hate what you did."<br>
I hate you for what you did.</P>
<P align="center">You knew me, knew my weak points<br>
knew how and<br>
by who.</P>
<P align="center">But you convinced me<br>
with your soothing promises<br>
and whispered words<br>
that you could help<br>
you convinced me to bare my soul<br>
in tiny portions<br>
for I do not trust.</P>
<P align="center">I do so, sharing painfully<br>
as it is not my way</P>
<P align="center">And I am rewarded with the same<br>
which I have come to expect -<br>
mocking, cackling laughter that haunts me<br>
nights as I toss and turn in bed</P>
<P align="center">Laughter that hurts, not heals<br>
that rubs salt into open wounds<br>
and leaves injuries to fester in the soul<br>
nourished by the remembrance of the<br>
humiliation and<br>
betrayal.</P>
<P align="center">I trusted,<br>
was foolish enough to believe in you.<br>
You helped me, proved me right<br>
in teaching me that none can be trusted<br>
with the secrets of the soul.</P>
<P align="center">The offering was one that was so deeply personal<br>
I did not send it for over a week, unsure if I was<br>
ready to bare<br>
my soul.</P>
<P align="center">It was my way of externalizing the pain, of being able to<br>
express it physically and lasting.  So I cut, deep and long<br>
and immortalized the moment.  Even after the external scars have long<br>
healed,<br>
the scars inside will still be healing, the wounds still festering in my<br>
spirit.<br>
And this image will be there, reminding that the pain is real<br>
the feelings are real<br>
It is real.</P>
<P align="center">And I offered this image to you, this deeply personal picture<br>
of my spirit</P>
<P align="center">And you laughed.</P><hr class="divider-line">

<P align="center" class="item-title">Colors</P>
<P align="center">Snap out of it you say<br>
but you do not understand<br>
how I try.<br>
Flooding my bear at night with salty sorrow<br>
twisting my pillow<br>
into impossible knots<br>
trying to understand<br>
why.<br>
Why do I feel this way<br>
what have I done?<br>
Why am I so burdened<br>
by sadness?<br>
Was I a bad person?<br>
Did I do wrong?<br>
What must I do to be able to release<br>
that which I do not know<br>
I hold onto?<br>
Do you think me weak willed?<br>
Do you think I do not try?</P>
<P align="center">Maybe that I am selfish<br>
seeking the pity of others.<br>
But you do not see my secret tears<br>
the torment which tears my soul to shreds<br>
nightly<br>
in the quiet hours of the day<br>
always haunting<br>
though never in reach.<br>
I do try.<br>
I do not want to feel lost<br>
and alone<br>
afraid<br>
scared<br>
overwhelmed by sadness<br>
with nowhere to turn<br>
no one who can understand.</P>
<P align="center">I cannot just snap out of it<br>
I wish you could see this.<br>
I wish you would come to me<br>
and tell me that it is ok.<br>
That you love me<br>
and that nothing will happen.<br>
But you can't.<br>
I'm not loveable<br>
I've been turned away.<br>
The doctors who won't see me<br>
The hopes I can spend time with loved ones<br>
soon dashed by bad news<br>
I am less important<br>
but I can not say this<br>
it would be taken wrongly.<br>
Friends I suddenly feel like a burden to<br>
I am sorry<br>
I do not know how to be a friend I guess.<br>
Do you not think I want<br>
to just make a decision<br>
to release all my cares<br>
and have no more pain?<br>
Is my pain less real<br>
than that of a broken leg?<br>
Are my tears<br>
less worthy<br>
than those of a child<br>
with a scuffed knee?<br>
Why do you turn me away?<br>
A pile of a thousand mournful good-byes<br>
repentance for a hundred misdeeds<br>
torment for everyone I've ever hurt<br>
all weigh on my shoulders<br>
growing heavier by the day<br>
though I do not know why.<br>
I can not tell you the reasons<br>
that I can not release everything.<br>
I can not point to wrongs that I have done<br>
things I've missed or lost<br>
that cause this pain to me<br>
or what teary good-byes<br>
plague my memories<br>
refusing to move on.<br>
I do not know<br>
but you do not understand this<br>
for in your mind<br>
there is a reason for everything.</P>
<P align="center">I can not snap out of it.<br>
I am sorry.<br>
I wish I could.</P>
<P align="center">Oh how I wish I could.</P><hr class="divider-line">

<P align="center" class="item-title">Colors</P>
<P align="center">Fear of what I see encompasses me<br>
surrounds me with its icy fingers<br>
reaching to chill my soul.<br>
The open wounds of my soul<br>
desperately trying to mend<br>
not knowing how<br>
under the black veil of my heart.<br>
Trapped am I<br>
not knowing where to turn<br>
what to do<br>
where to go<br>
how to express<br>
the bleakness I feel.<br>
Dark are my words<br>
scaring me to read<br>
what I write with unbridled emotion<br>
tears running down my face<br>
staining my skin<br>
and cleansing my soul<br>
with their salty tang.<br>
Hope appears sometimes<br>
a bright pinprick of light<br>
through the old steadfast walls<br>
built around me.<br>
It disappears with the wind<br>
leaving me confused.<br>
Was it here?<br>
Or was it just my imagination<br>
seeking to find a reason to live<br>
when my soul wants to curl up and die.<br>
I do not know yellow.<br>
The yellow of smiling faces<br>
of bright daisies on a warmed hill at dawn<br>
of a golden sun set against a sapphire sky.<br>
I know navy<br>
of sorrow and despair</P>
<P align="center">Red<br>
of anger and torment</P>
<P align="center">Black<br>
of hopelessness and nothing<br>
of comfort and shadowy nooks.</P>
<P align="center">I hide in the colors familiar to me<br>
seeking refuge in their familiarity<br>
blinded by the yellows of the world<br>
unable to comprehend the joy<br>
backing slowly from the confusion.</P>
<P align="center">Heartless people<br>
around me<br>
invading<br>
I hate<br>
and I hate the feeling<br>
hating them<br>
seeing red.</P>
<P align="center">Night falls<br>
the sky turning dark<br>
and my spirits as well<br>
no hope lies in the night air<br>
only confusion and worry<br>
tears<br>
with no one to see<br>
no one allowed to see<br>
gazing out to stare<br>
at a canvas of navy.<br>
Wrapped in a veil of comfort<br>
of familiarity<br>
of the deepest ebony<br>
clinging like a lost child<br>
feeling like a lost soul.<br>
I wish I could see the yellows.</p>
